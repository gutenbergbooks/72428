<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
THE VIATICUM.
</h3>

<p>
Upon most of the people who thronged the
rooms the incident was lost.  Of those who
saw it many did not understand its meaning,
and the rest were too much absorbed in their
own affairs to give it any attention.  The
scene was the Casino at Monto Carlo; every
chair was occupied, and behind every chair
men and women were standing, all intent
upon the play, all consumed by the feverish
thirst of winning money born of the
atmosphere of the place.  The brilliant light
flashed in jewels and gleamed in eager eyes,
heightened the colour of flushed cheeks and
emphasised the pallor of haggard faces;
against the black evening coat of one man
sitting down was outlined the bare arm of a
woman, who laid her stake upon the table,
and when the hand was withdrawn it still
hesitated over the black coat until the
fortune of the stake should be declared.
Dominating everything was the monotonous
sound of the croupiers' voices and the noise
of the money as it was raked to and fro
upon the tables.
</p>

<p>
The incident which took place in this
scene was a not uncommon one.  It was a
little procession of three men, one a dark,
good-looking man in well-cut evening dress,
who walked nonchalantly through the rooms,
pausing almost imperceptibly while his two
companions shot a glance of interrogation at
each of the croupiers; when the croupiers,
in reply, had shot a glance of assent at his
companions, the dark man moved on again
until he had almost completed his tour of
the rooms.  It was Melville Ashley
undergoing the process of identification as a
well-known frequenter of the rooms before
receiving the <i>viaticum</i> which should enable
him to return to London.
</p>

<p>
It is the habit of the Englishman to conceal
his feelings, and no one could have guessed
from Melville's demeanour whether he
experienced relief at having come to the end of
his tether, regret at knowing that he could
play no more that season, mortification at
his somewhat humiliating position, or any
other emotion which one may suppose natural
to a gambler who is suddenly baulked in his
pursuits.  He seemed entirely unconcerned,
perhaps a little bored, but certainly in
complete possession of himself.  To the few
people who, knowing him, found time to
vouchsafe him a nod of greeting, he bowed
pleasantly enough.  Of the existence of the
others he appeared unaware, though, in
point of fact, his senses were so alert that he
could have supplied a remarkably close
description of everyone had he been asked to
do so.  For the time the gambling fever had
left him, and with the vanishing of his last
coin there awoke in his mind an intense
disgust at the heavy scent in the air and the
grotesque sight of the many pairs of white
gloves.  He was only anxious for the great
baize doors to swing behind him and exclude
him from what was generally the one desire
of his heart.
</p>

<p>
Only once did he betray any interest.  A
woman leaning back in her chair put out
her hand to detain him.  She understood the
significance of his escort, and there was
some commiseration in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going home, Mr. Ashley?" she
asked, in a low tone.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answered, with a little smile;
"I leave to-night."
</p>

<p>
In those conventional words was conveyed
a perfectly frank confession of the state of
his finances.  No need to invent any
explanation of so sudden a departure.  His
questioner was well enough acquainted with
the language of the place to know that he
had pledged his word to return at once to
London, in consideration of value received.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," she said, and looked as if
she meant it; "but I daresay I shall be
following you soon, and then, perhaps, we may
meet again.  London is a tiny little place."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Melville assented politely; "but
wouldn't it be as well if you gave me one of
your cards?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't any," said Mrs. Sinclair, smiling
lightly, for she liked a sportsmanlike loser.
"Men always carry cards&mdash;in case of duels,
I suppose, but women have no room in their
purses for anything but money, and nowhere
but their purses to put anything else.  Give
me one of yours, and I will write to you."
</p>

<p>
"That is too good of you," he replied, as
he gave her one; "but of course you will
forget all about it.  Good-night, good-bye."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Auf wiedersehen</i>," she answered prettily,
and turned to her companion on her left,
who had watched the little comedy with a
scowl upon his face.  Melville noted the
scowl and bowed sardonically as he moved
away.  To be conscious of superiority to
anyone is satisfactory in one's hour of
discomfiture, and Melville derived a complacent
satisfaction from this little man's evident
annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"The little bounder doesn't like me," he
thought, "but he's a little ass to show it.
He must be very rich for Mrs. Sinclair to be
willing to lay aside her weeds for him."
</p>

<p>
The doors swung behind him, and in
another moment Melville was in the open air.
He stretched out his arms in pure enjoyment
of the lovely night.
</p>

<p>
"I am infinitely obliged to you," he said
to his escort; "the other trifling formalities
will, doubtless, be completed in due course;"
and in what seemed an incredibly short time
Melville was on his way to London.
</p>

<p>
Inside the Casino, the little bounder turned
to his companion.
</p>

<p>
"Since you have no room in your purse
for visiting cards," he said, "may I not keep
that one in safe custody for you?"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, no," the woman answered, and
slipped it inside her dress; "I haven't
finished playing yet, and my luck is in
to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Would you be as kind to me," he
pursued, "if I had to have recourse to the
charity of the bank to pay my fare to London?
Or would you drop me when my money
went?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sinclair looked at him coolly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't ask leading questions, and please
don't make yourself ridiculous.  Civility costs
nothing, and it amused me to be civil to
that&mdash;gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"It is rare for you to be amused with
anything that costs nothing," he retorted,
but Mrs. Sinclair would not be drawn.  She
began to play again, and, when at last she
stopped, the little man's carrying capacity was
taxed to take her winnings back to her hotel.
</p>

<p>
It would be a vain task to try to record
all Melville Ashley's thoughts as the train bore
him across France; in the aggregate they
amounted to little less than a comprehensive
cursing of everything and everybody, including
himself.  For his position was desperate.
</p>

<p>
The younger son of his parents, both of
whom had died while he was still an infant,
he had been brought up with his brother
Ralph under the guardianship of his uncle,
Sir Geoffrey Holt, lord of the manor of
Fairbridge, in Surrey, whose co-heir, at any
rate, he hoped some day to be.  Sir Geoffrey
had played his part well, placing every
advantage in the way of both his nephews,
but as the years slipped by he found it
difficult to be quite impartial in his personal
treatment of the two lads, though he never
failed to be impartial in his dealings with
them so far as they affected the education
and up-bringing of the boys.
</p>

<p>
It was Ralph, however, who engrossed
his uncle's affection, and something in
Melville's nature rose in rebellion at the thought
that he came second in the estimation of
any person.  Both boys were handsome,
Melville especially so; both were well
endowed with intelligence, and both took
advantage of their opportunities.  But whereas
Ralph developed into a frank and unaffected
man, fond of athletics and outdoor pursuits,
Melville became more and more self-centred
and reserved, devoting all his time to his one
absorbing love of music.  Manhood brought
liberty, and liberty in Melville's case brought
lack of self-restraint.  His finer qualities led
him into a certain sort of temptation, and
the men with whom his rare musical talents
brought him into contact were of a free and
easy Bohemian type that did not afford the
most healthy companionship for a young
fellow of his particular temperament.  Musical
evenings led to smoking concerts, and the
concerts to late nights of which other and
less innocent amusements were the principal
feature; billiards and cards became first a
habit and then a passion, and Melville was
still in his early twenties when it was obvious
that he was a confirmed gambler.
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey was patient and he was rich,
but detestation of the gambler was added to
his dislike of his younger nephew, and more
than one violent quarrel had taken place
between the two.  It says much for the elder
man that he never referred to the position
of absolute dependence occupied by the
younger one; but when, a few weeks before,
Melville came to him with the oft-repeated tale,
Sir Geoffrey spoke his mind in the vernacular.
</p>

<p>
"Let me know the sum total of your
accursed debts," he said, "if you have the
honesty or the wit to remember them, and I
will clean the slate.  Then I will give you a
final two hundred and fifty for yourself, and
that shall be the end."
</p>

<p>
When Melville gave him the damning list
of debts, Sir Geoffrey bit his lips until they
bled.  Livery stables, and wine and cigar
merchants told a tale of luxurious living
which Sir Geoffrey himself had never been
able to afford in his younger days, and there
were other items not precisely specified, into
which the elder man thought it better not
to enquire too curiously.  But he kept his
word.  He drew crossed cheques payable to
every person named in the list for the full
amount, and demanded a receipt from each in
full discharge of his nephew's liability.  When
the last receipt came in, after a miserable week
of waiting, he sent for Melville to his library.
</p>

<p>
"Is that the last?" he enquired grimly,
and Melville assented.  Then Sir Geoffrey
sat down at his table and drew one cheque
more.  "There is the two hundred and fifty
I promised you," he said; "make the best
use of it you can, for it is the last you ever
have from me.  The dog-cart will take you
to the station in half-an-hour."  Then he
turned on his heel and left him, and Melville
returned to town.
</p>

<p>
Five weeks before!  And now the whole
of the money was gone.  With all his
ingenuity it would be difficult to invent a story
which his uncle would be likely to accept as
a valid explanation of so surprising a fact.
</p>

<p>
Melville lighted a cigar and cursed his
luck again.
</p>

<p>
Then the gambler's spirit re-asserted itself.
He had had a glorious time at Monte Carlo
while it lasted.  One night he had won more
than five thousand pounds, and another
night the bank had to send out twice for
fresh supplies of money.  That was the time
of triumph.  People had crowded round him,
some to follow his play, some to envy, some
to congratulate him, and among them he had
seen Lavender Sinclair for the first time: a
magnificent woman truly, with splendid
colouring and grandly moulded limbs; she
wore turquoise velvet, he remembered, and
round her neck a barbaric collar of turquoise
bosses linked together on red gold; even in
that room, where jewels were as common as
morals were rare, her jewels were conspicuous,
and she wore them perfectly.  Some acquaintance
introduced him to her, and she seemed
interested in hearing his name&mdash;had met
people who knew him, or some distant
kinsmen, but there was no indication of any
desire on her part to press the acquaintance.
She was in the ripest glory of her beauty,
the sort that is at its best when it is mature.
He wondered idly how old she was, over
thirty certainly; but, after all, it did not
matter.  Rumour had it that she was going
to marry Sir Ross Buchanan, and Melville
was contemptuous of her choice of a second
husband; he knew the man by sight, an
undersized, rather weakly fellow, who inherited
an old title from his father and, it was said,
two millions sterling from his mother.  Sir
Ross was a pill that required an unusual
amount of gilding, and Melville's first
admiration of the woman was replaced by scorn of
her venality.  She was sympathetic though
when he bade her good-bye, and Melville
appreciated sympathy.
</p>

<p>
The journey was very tedious, so Melville
opened his dressing-case and took out a
packet of letters which had reached him at
the hotel, but to which he had not troubled
to attend.  Several he tore up and threw
away, but there was one which he carefully
replaced in its envelope in his bag.  It was
from his brother, and ran as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"DEAR MELVILLE,&mdash;Why didn't you tell
me you were going to Monte Carlo?  However,
I hope you are enjoying yourself and
having good luck.  By the way, I am going
to ask you to do me a great favour.  Can
you lend me a hundred for a fortnight?  I
will repay you then.  My solicitors are selling
some capital for me, but they are so slow,
and I am in immediate want of the money.
Do write soon.&mdash;Yours ever, RALPH ASHLEY.
P.S.&mdash;Have you heard of my engagement to
Gwendolen Austen?"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"So he is hard up, too," Melville muttered.
"No, I wouldn't lend him fifty pounds if I
had fifty thousand to-morrow.  And engaged
to Gwendolen is he?  I wonder if I can put
an end to that.  If she were my wife I might
even win the old man round again."
</p>

<p>
Then his mind reverted to his immediate
difficulties, and he went over the old useless
ground of trying to think of some way to
raise the wind, failing once more to see any
light at all, as indeed he was bound to fail,
since honest work did not come into his
most casual consideration.
</p>

<p>
It was not, however, until he found himself
in his chambers in Jermyn Street that he
fully realised how he had come to the end
of all things.  There were invitations awaiting
him which he could not accept for lack of
ready money; little accounts which he would
have been only too glad to hand over to his
uncle if he had remembered their existence;
all insignificant enough individually, but
totalling up to a considerable sum; private
tips from hangers-on at stables, which were
certain to be good since he could not avail
himself of them; letters from women
suggesting trips up the river or supper after the
play; even letters from friends saying they
were hard up, and reminding him of small
obligations under which he lay to them.
Melville felt as if he were at last at bay, with
all his worries like so many starving wolves
tearing him down to his destruction.  And
worse than all was the extreme physical
reaction from the unwholesome life of
excitement he had lately been leading at Monte
Carlo.  While that life lasted no fatigue
oppressed him.  A tumbler of champagne or
a stiff pick-me-up from a chemist always
availed to keep him going.  But now the
excitement was over.  The curtain was rung
down, the lights were all turned out, he was
alone with his troubles, and had no pluck left
to face them.  In sheer weariness he turned
into bed and slept the sleep of deep
exhaustion.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap02"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD.
</h3>

<p>
Even while Melville, with despair gnawing
at his heart, was speeding on his journey
back to England, Sir Geoffrey Holt was
keeping festival at Fairbridge Manor.  That
very evening he had given a final dinner
party to celebrate the betrothal of his
god-child, Gwendolen Austen, to his favourite
nephew, Ralph Ashley.
</p>

<p>
In the whole of a land which is proud to
claim as its children so many fair women and
brave men, it would be difficult to find a
fairer woman or a braver man than now
engrossed Sir Geoffrey's thoughts, and in
their approaching union he looked to see the
culmination of his own happiness.  It was
infinitely pleasant to know that the two, over
whose lives he had watched so tenderly,
would never leave him now, but hand-in-hand
would walk in quiet contentment by
his side, lightening the burden of his
increasing years, and giving him fresh pleasure
in their own unfolding joys.  No man could
ever hope to win richer reward for his
unfailing goodness to others than Sir Geoffrey
was reaping now for his long care of this
boy and girl.
</p>

<p>
So he threw wide his hospitable doors, and
asked the county to come and shower
congratulations upon the happy couple.  For a
week he kept open house, and his pleasure
was so apparent, his high spirits so contagious,
that he made himself loved the more by his
unaffected delight and his manner of displaying
it.  To his succession of dinner parties
practically the entire county came, until both
Ralph and Gwendolen were at a loss to find
fresh ways of saying, "Thank you," for so
many expressions of goodwill.
</p>

<p>
But this evening had brought the
entertainments to a close, and when Sir Geoffrey,
standing by his open door, had bade the
latest guest good-bye, he turned with a sigh
of satisfaction into the great hall where his
children, as he called them, were laughing
over some incident which had amused them
during the day.
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey pulled his god-daughter
towards him and held her face between his
hands.
</p>

<p>
"The last guest gone," he said, smiling at
her; "now, Gwen, confess you are not
sorry."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know there was so much kindness
in the world," she answered, smiling back at
him, and her eyes were shining; "but I
confess I am glad we are all by ourselves
again."
</p>

<p>
"Tired?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit," she answered brightly;
"unless it be of seeming to occupy so much
attention."
</p>

<p>
"And you don't want to go to bed?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, no," she said indignantly.
"When one is as happy as I am it would be
a shame to spend a single hour asleep."
</p>

<p>
"Then let us go down to the house-boat,"
Sir Geoffrey said.  "I daresay Ralph can
manage to amuse you somehow, and I want
to talk to your mother."
</p>

<p>
"Do you want to talk to me, Ralph?"
said Gwendolen, turning to her lover, who
was looking at her with affectionate pride.
</p>

<p>
"I don't seem to have had a chance of
talking to you for a week," Ralph answered
promptly.  "Let's go at once and&mdash;and get a
deck chair ready for your mother."
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"An admirable reason for both of you
hurrying away.  Ralph is too weak to move
one by himself; you must help him, Gwendolen."
</p>

<p>
Ralph put a wrap round Gwendolen, and,
linking her arm in his, went through the
French window across the garden.
</p>

<p>
It was a glorious night.  A full moon shed
a mellow splendour across the lawns, throwing
the masses of the cedars into bold relief
against the sky, and glinting in all the
diamond panes of the heavy-leaded windows.
Over the phloxes and tobacco plants that
adorned the borders great moths were wheeling,
and bats were flickering in and out of
the plantation that screened the stables from
the house.  As the garden sloped towards
the river the turf was more closely shaven,
and along the water's edge were sunk pots in
which magnificent geraniums and sweet
heliotrope were growing.
</p>

<p>
Moored by the extreme boundary of the
garden Ralph's house-boat lay; it contained
a little bedroom and two sitting-rooms,
fragrant with flowers and light with mirrors
and thin curtains, and the upper part,
covered in with a pale green awning, was a
mass of flowers and palms.  Here were deck
chairs, and little tables, and Japanese lanterns.
</p>

<p>
Ralph put two chairs ready for Mrs. Austen
and Sir Geoffrey, and then looked at Gwendolen.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we wait here for them, or would you
like me to punt you up the stream?"
</p>

<p>
"Let us stay here," she answered; "somehow&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" he said enquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"Somehow I fancy the others will not
come," she said, rippling with laughter.
"Sir Geoffrey is always so thoughtful."
</p>

<p>
Ralph took her in his arms and kissed her
passionately.
</p>

<p>
"I love you&mdash;I love you," he said, between
set teeth, and Gwendolen drew a sigh of
perfect content.  "If it could always be like
this," he went on.  "Just you and I in the
peace, with the river and the moonlight to
reflect our happiness."
</p>

<p>
But Gwendolen shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"You would soon tire of that," she said,
and when he would have demurred laid her
hand upon his lips.  "I hope you would, at
any rate, for I would not like you to be a
lotos-eater dreaming your days away.  There
is so much to do in the world, Ralph, and
surely we, to whom so much has been given,
would not wish to give nothing in return."
</p>

<p>
He kissed the hand that caressed him.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me what I am to do."
</p>

<p>
Gwendolen considered.
</p>

<p>
"It is not easy to see just at first," she
admitted, "but work, like charity, begins at
home.  You will be a good master to your
household, and will take an active interest in
the estate.  You will be so anxious to make
the tenants happier in their respective stations
that you will be surprised to find how many
things go to make up their lives.  Life is a
big bundle of little things, you know, not a
little bundle of big ones.  If you really set
your heart upon doing good you will never
stop for lack of something to do.  That is a
wonderful thought, Ralph: there is no end
to the good you can do in the world."
</p>

<p>
"Go on," he said tenderly; "go on, dear,
good little woman!"
</p>

<p>
"That is only thinking of your life at
home," said Gwendolen; "but there are
wider interests outside.  I should like you to
make a name for yourself in the great world;
it might be in philanthropy, it might be in
politics.  I'm often sorry you have no
profession, but the world has always need of
good men, and I won't let you hold wool for
me while the world wants one pair of honest
hands.  Oh!  Ralph, wouldn't that be more
worth while than idling your life away, even
if it could always be like this?"
</p>

<p>
"Much more worth while," he answered
gravely.  "You have made me happy; you
will make me good; you may make me
famous.  That is a great deal for one little
woman to do for a man.  What am I to do
in return for you?"
</p>

<p>
"Only love me," she said.  "Love me
always as you do now; never any less
tenderly or truly, even when the other
interests are nearer than they are to-night.
What more can you do than give me love&mdash;the
best thing in the world?"
</p>

<p>
"I think I may safely promise that,"
Ralph said, and his deep voice quivered.
What had he done that Providence should
heap blessings on him so lavishly?  For
what had already been bestowed upon him
he could never show sufficient gratitude, and
now there was the crowning gift of all&mdash;the
love of a pure and beautiful girl, whom he
knew he had loved all his life.
</p>

<p>
Gwendolen lay back in one of the deck
chairs, and Ralph, leaning against the wooden
railing, feasted his eyes upon the picture that
she made.  In a dress of white <i>mousseline-de-soie</i>,
trimmed with rare point lace, she
looked ethereally beautiful in this setting of
coloured lamps and lovely flowers.  Her
hands were clasped upon her lap, and the
moonlight caught the diamonds in the ring
that he had given her, and even sought out
the little diamond drop that did duty as an
earring.  Against the scarlet cushions on
which she reclined her fair skin showed like
ivory, and Ralph was filled with something
akin to amazement that this incarnation of
all that was sweet and lovely in English
womanhood would soon be his to have and
to hold for ever.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes, large, brown, and true, were
fixed steadfastly on him, and found no less
pleasure in what they saw than his did.  In
his evening dress Ralph looked taller than
the six feet that he actually measured; fair
hair curled crisply over a sun-tanned face,
in every line of which frank candour was
written, and his athletic figure was graceful
in every involuntary pose.  Gwendolen had
reason to be proud of her lover as he thus
stood silhouetted against the moonlit sky,
and she made no secret of it to herself that
she found pleasure in his unconscious show
of great strength in restraint.  He could kill
her with so little effort of those well-shaped,
nervous hands, and yet one look from her
could make his whole frame tremble.
</p>

<p>
So in silence they communed together, as
is the way with lovers who know that no
words can express a tithe of their deep
emotion.  And, indeed, while lovers have eyes
to see, they do not need tongues to speak.
Silence is best when two hearts are in accord.
</p>

<p>
The silence was broken by Sir Geoffrey's
voice talking to Mrs. Austen as they came
over the velvety turf.  Sir Geoffrey helped
his companion on to the houseboat and
followed her up the stairway.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive us for being so long, Gwendolen,"
he said in his cheery, bantering fashion.
"I hope my nephew has been doing his best
to entertain you."
</p>

<p>
"He has been behaving very nicely,"
Gwendolen replied, "and I think you have
brought him up very well."
</p>

<p>
"I told Martin to bring us some coffee
and liqueurs," Sir Geoffrey went on, "and
I'm going to smoke, if you ladies will allow
me, and look at the reflections in the water,
and fancy I'm young again."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Austen protested.
</p>

<p>
"You are young, until you feel old," she
said, "and you don't feel that to-night."
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't," said Sir Geoffrey stoutly.
"This is an ideal ending to one of the happiest
days of my life, and if a man is only as old
as he feels, I shall come of age on Ralph's
wedding-day."  He lighted a cigar and flung
the match into the river.  "Have a cigar,
Ralph?  I'm sure you have earned it."  The
old fellow was pleased that his nephew could
not chime in with his trivial chatter, and
pulling up a chair by Gwendolen's side, he
patted her hand.  "Happy, Gwen?" he
asked, and as the answering smile dawned in
the girl's dark eyes, he wiped his own, which
suddenly grew misty.  "That's right, that's
right," he said quickly.  "Ah! here is
Martin with the tray."
</p>

<p>
Allured by the material pleasures of
tobacco and liqueurs, Ralph descended to
earth again, and soon the little party were
laughing and chatting merrily enough.  Soft
strains of music from another houseboat were
carried down to them, and presently a young
fellow poled a racing punt swiftly down the
stream; two swans floated out from underneath
the trees, rocking gracefully on the
water ruffled by the punt; and from the
tender came suggestively domestic sounds as
the old butler put away the cups and saucers
and decanted whiskey for the men.
</p>

<p>
Then presently they strolled back to the
manor house and lingered for a little in the
hall; and while Ralph took his time to bid
Gwendolen good-night, Sir Geoffrey found
opportunity to say a few more words to
Mrs. Austen.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could tell you how happy I am,"
he said.  "I have hoped for this all my life,
and now it has come to pass.  They both
are worthy of each other, and to see such
happiness as theirs is almost as good as
having it oneself."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Austen cordially agreed, but she
wondered if Sir Geoffrey's hearty words were
at all belied by the sigh that accompanied
them.  Yet she stifled the suspicion as it
was born, for no woman lives long enough to
give her child in marriage without learning
the truth that underlies the words:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Our sincerest laughter<br>
  With some pain is fraught;<br>
  Our sweetest songs are those that<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tell of saddest thought."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Then, with the curiosity of her sex, she
wondered again, as she had so often wondered
before, why Sir Geoffrey Holt himself had
never married.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
FRAUD.
</h3>

<p>
Rather more than a week elapsed, during
which Melville saw practically nothing of
the outer world.  His chambers were at the
top of the house in Jermyn Street, the suite
consisting of a sitting, bed, and bath rooms,
which he rented furnished for seventy pounds
a year.  His food and attendance were all
supplied to him by the general manager of
the house, and his credit for these bare
necessaries of life was still good.  So Melville
gave orders to the hall porter to reply
uniformly to all enquirers that he was not at
home, and remained in his chambers steeped
in dull melancholy.  One evening he stole out
and pawned his violin, but that very night
he lost nearly all the proceeds of the
transaction in some utterly foolish wager, and
the next morning he woke up face to face
with the fact that he only possessed ten
shillings in the world.  It was pouring with
rain and the wind was howling round the
balustrade outside his windows.  Melville
shivered; he felt cold and ill, and recollected
that he had eaten no dinner the night before.
He rang the bell and told the valet, whose
services he shared with the other tenants on
his floor, to bring him up some breakfast and
some shaving water.
</p>

<p>
"What is the time?" he asked curtly, as
the man came from his bedroom to say the
shaving water was ready.
</p>

<p>
"About twelve, sir.  I will bring up your
breakfast in a quarter of an hour."
</p>

<p>
Melville turned to the window again.  If
only the rain would stop!  And how he
missed his violin!  No human being could
realise what his instrument had been to him,
or what a wrench it had been to part with it.
He felt utterly destitute.
</p>

<p>
"What am I to do?" he muttered vainly.
"Sir Geoffrey&mdash;no, it's worse than useless to
apply to him&mdash;last time was the last time,
unless some marvellous inspiration helps me
to pitch some plausible yarn."
</p>

<p>
While he was still harping on the one
perpetual theme, the valet returned with his
breakfast, and Melville drank some tea and
disposed of some excellent kidneys.
</p>

<p>
"I was getting quite faint," he said to
the man who was attending to him.  "Don't
bother about things this morning.  I shall
go out presently, and you can do whatever
you've got to do then."
</p>

<p>
"It's a very wet day, sir," the other
answered.
</p>

<p>
"Wet?" said Melville disgustedly.  "I
should think it is wet.  The weather certainly
means business."  He drank some more tea
and lighted a cigarette.  "By the way, put
out my dress clothes early this evening.  I
probably shall not be dining at home."
</p>

<p>
The valet hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Have you any more linen in any other
portmanteau, sir?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I don't know," Melville replied
testily.  "You'd better look and see.
Anyhow, find some."
</p>

<p>
The valet looked still more uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
"I sent all I could find to the wash, sir,"
he stammered; "and the laundry people
have refused to leave any clean linen until
your account is settled."
</p>

<p>
Melville grew scarlet with anger.
</p>

<p>
"What do I owe them?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"It's a little over four pounds, sir.  Will
you write a cheque?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I won't," said Melville shortly.
"Go to the Burlington Arcade and tell my
hosiers to send me over three dozen, and put
them down in my account."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said the valet civilly, and left
the room.
</p>

<p>
Melville laughed when the door closed
behind the servant.  When the devil laughs
it is time for good folks to beware, and
Melville felt like a fiend at that moment.  It
was grotesquely funny that he could get three
dozen shirts on credit, but had not the money
to pay his washerwoman.  But the fact was
a staggering reminder of his real position.
He got up preparatory to going out, when he
remembered that he had still to shave; he
went, therefore, into his bedroom, and, having
stropped his razor, took off his collar and
tie and began to make a lather for his face.
</p>

<p>
And then suddenly the idea came to him
with the force of a conviction that the way
out of his trouble lay plain before him.  It
was the cowardly way which it yet requires a
measure of courage to take.  Death was the
solution of the problem.  He did not know
how to live, but it was very simple to die.
He sat down in a chair and, almost closing
his eyes, peered at his reflection in the mirror.
Very little paler&mdash;only with eyes quite closed&mdash;he
would not look very different presently
if he did this thing.  And, unless his courage
failed him in the act, it would not hurt.
Then what would happen?  The scene here,
in this room, with the dead body stretched
upon the floor, was easy to imagine.  It
might not be very appalling.  Had he ever
contemplated such a deed before he would
have provided himself with some poison,
which, while it was as fatal as the razor
blade, would not disfigure him; for to the
living man the idea of being disfigured after
death is always repugnant.  But he had no
poison, and here was the razor ready to his
hand.  He would be found quite soon&mdash;but
it must not be too soon&mdash;and he rose and
stealthily locked the outer door.
</p>

<p>
Again he sat before the impassive mirror.
There was no one who would care.  In all
the world, so far as Melville knew, there was
no one who would care if he were dead, only
a few who would resent the manner of his
dying.
</p>

<p>
He had nothing left to lose.  Penniless and
friendless in the present, bankrupt of hope
for the future, he had nothing material left
to lose, at any rate, and he stood to gain
emancipation from an environment to which
he had ceased to be adapted.
</p>

<p>
He would have to draw the blade across
his throat&mdash;so!  He must do it very strongly,
very swiftly, or he would fail.
</p>

<p>
The man leant forward on the dressing-table
and gazed closely at himself in the
glass; he saw exactly where he must make
the gash, and without any hesitation or
nervousness he felt the edge of the razor
with the thumb of his left hand.  As he
did so he cut the skin, and some blood fell
upon the snow-white cover of the table.  In
the extraordinary mental state in which he
was, the horrible incongruity in his reasoning
did not strike him, but, in actual fact, the
bloodstain on the cloth gave him offence, and
he paused and looked around him.  This&mdash;would
make such a mess!  And there was a
revolver in his bag.  How stupid of him not
to have remembered that!  It had another
advantage, too, for people might think the
pistol had gone off by accident while he was
cleaning it, whereas there could be no doubt
about the intention in the other case.  It
mattered a great deal what people would
think.
</p>

<p>
He laid down the razor on a chest of
drawers and removed the soiled toilet cover
from the dressing table.  Then he went to
his bag to take out his revolver.  The valet
had disarranged the contents of the bag, and
Melville turned over a lot of things and could
not find the little pistol case.  Instead, his
hand fell upon a heap of letters, and on the
top of them was the one that had come to
him from Ralph asking for a loan of a hundred
pounds.
</p>

<p>
A sudden revulsion of thought made Melville
sick and giddy.  It was as if a gambler
who had lost all but his last five-franc piece
had, after hesitation, staked <i>en plein</i> and
followed with a run of wins on single numbers.
One cannot follow up the gambler's line of
thought, but many a one whom that fortune
befell would be almost sick to think how
narrowly he missed his chance.  Melville was
a gambler pure and simple.  An instant
before he had been upon the very point of
death because he did not know whence
money could be got, and without money he
did not want to live.  Yet here in his bag
was a letter which might mean at least a
hundred pounds.  Of course, he might lose
his stake, but to kill himself without having
made the venture was intolerable.
</p>

<p>
The physical endurance of the strongest
man has its limitations, and Melville staggered
into the sitting-room and threw himself into
a great armchair.  Here presently he was
discovered by his valet, who was frightened
by his master's complete collapse.  Some
hours passed by before he regained anything
like his usual self-control, and then, resolutely
putting out of his mind all thought of how
close he had been to death, he began to
consider the best time and manner of making
his final venture to raise money.
</p>

<p>
A train left Waterloo at six-forty, which
would land him at Fairbridge Manor at
eight o'clock.  If he went by that train he
would in all probability find Sir Geoffrey Holt
in a good humour after dinner.  He even
took the precaution of changing his clothes
again, substituting a somewhat shabby lounge
suit for his elaborate frock coat.  "May
as well look the part," he said sardonically
to himself.  "The Prodigal Son was a bit
baggy at the knees, I imagine, and that is
the scene I'm on in now.  I shall have to
draw on my imagination about the husks
all the same."
</p>

<p>
There was something almost heroic&mdash;in a
wicked fashion&mdash;in his effort to pull himself
together, for his recent temptation to commit
suicide had really shaken him.  He drank
freely of the spirits in his tantalus as he was
dressing, and all the while tried to anticipate
every difficulty in the interview before him.
</p>

<p>
"If only Ralph is out of the way I may
pull it off.  His letter will serve to account
for one hundred of the last two-fifty, and
I can gas about some forgotten bills to
explain how most of the rest has gone.  It's
a fighting chance anyhow, and if I fail there
is still the pistol."
</p>

<p>
From one thought sprang another.
</p>

<p>
"There is still the pistol!"
</p>

<p>
With a curiously furtive action Melville
took the revolver from his portmanteau and
slipped it into his pocket.  Then he crept
downstairs, and, hailing a hansom, drove to
Waterloo.
</p>

<p>
But when the train steamed into Fairbridge
Station, Melville was not in it.  He
was so restless that he could not endure the
swaying of the carriage, and getting out two
stations short of his destination he resolved
to walk the rest of the way.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the high road he made his way
down to the river and followed the towing
path.  It was getting dark, but the rain had
ceased; the silence was intense, and the
occasional splash of a water-rat startled him
so much that he was angry with himself
for being in so highly strung and nervous a
condition.
</p>

<p>
When at last he reached the gardens of
the Manor House he was feeling very shaky;
he walked quickly towards the house,
wondering, now the moment was at hand, how he
should begin.
</p>

<p>
"Ralph may be cornered for money," he
muttered, "but I notice he hasn't got rid
of his houseboat.  I wonder whether he is
here to-night.  Everything depends upon
that."
</p>

<p>
He crept cautiously up to the dining-room
windows and tried to peep through the blinds.
As he did so he heard the front door open,
and crouching down hid himself in some
shrubbery.  He recognised Sir Geoffrey's firm,
quick step, and peering over the laurels saw
his uncle walking with Ralph down the drive.
He watched them shake hands, and saw
Ralph walk briskly away; then he drew
back among the laurels as Sir Geoffrey
returned to the house and quietly closed
the door.
</p>

<p>
"So Ralph is here to-night," said Melville
under his breath; "my luck again!"
</p>

<p>
He felt horribly uncertain what to do.
His first impulse was to follow Ralph, who
might be going up to town, but he refrained,
and walked softly down to the towing path
again, turning round at every other step to
see if Sir Geoffrey were coming.  The evening
grew colder, and Melville turned up the collar
of his coat and stood back among the shadows,
steadying himself against a tree.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps that is Sir Geoffrey," he thought,
as the sound of footsteps fell upon his ear.
"No!  it's someone going the other way.
'Pon my word, I'm beginning to feel quite
guilty.  Still&mdash;I'm not going back without
seeing him.  Perhaps I'd better go up to the
house and get it over.  Why can't he come
down here as usual?"
</p>

<p>
He retraced his steps, and as he reached
the garden gate came face to face with Sir
Geoffrey, who, apparently, was not at all
surprised to see him.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do, uncle?" Melville said.
"I thought I would look you up."
</p>

<p>
"Very good of you, I'm sure," said Sir
Geoffrey drily.  "Have you just come from
the station?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, just this instant," Melville answered,
without thinking.
</p>

<p>
"H'm!" said Sir Geoffrey; "I suppose
they must have put on a new down train.
Did you meet Ralph?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Melville shortly.
</p>

<p>
"H'm!" said Sir Geoffrey again; "I
thought not."
</p>

<p>
"Not a very promising beginning!" said
Melville to himself; then he added aloud,
"Is Ralph staying with you?"
</p>

<p>
"He has been," said Sir Geoffrey, "and
he's coming back to-morrow, so I am sorry
I cannot offer you his room."
</p>

<p>
Melville was annoyed.
</p>

<p>
"I am not aware that I have asked you to
give me his room, and I am aware that you
prefer his company."
</p>

<p>
"That being so," said Sir Geoffrey, "it
seems to me that you have chosen a somewhat
unconventional hour for your visit."
</p>

<p>
"I've only just returned to England,"
Melville replied; "otherwise I should have
called earlier."
</p>

<p>
"May I ask the object of your visit now
you have called?" enquired Sir Geoffrey.
"What is it you want?" and he looked
keenly at his nephew.
</p>

<p>
"Well," Melville stammered, "the fact is
I wanted to ask you to give me some more
money.  I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But it's not two months since I gave you
two hundred and fifty pounds," cried Sir
Geoffrey.  "What on earth have you done
with that?"
</p>

<p>
Melville was at a loss how to begin the
explanation he had invented.
</p>

<p>
"I've been away," he said lamely, "and
ill, and&mdash;and it's gone."
</p>

<p>
"I can quite believe it's gone," said his
uncle bitterly.  "Money melts before you
like pyramids of snow.  I wonder you have
the face to ask me again."
</p>

<p>
Melville flushed.  He knew that Sir
Geoffrey had detected him in one lie, and
that in his present state of excitement he
would only make matters worse if he faltered
in his suddenly improvised story.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what am I to do?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Do what every other man does," Sir
Geoffrey said.  "Work, instead of idling
about in the club and playing the
fiddle&mdash;and the fool."
</p>

<p>
"But I can't get any work," Melville
objected.
</p>

<p>
"What have you tried to do?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's no good going into all that."
</p>

<p>
"I should think not," said Sir Geoffrey
with a bitter laugh, "but, anyhow, I won't
help you any more; men of your type never
will work while they've got any relations on
whom they can sponge.  You give up the
fiddle, as a start."
</p>

<p>
"I have," said Melville, "to a pawn-broker."
</p>

<p>
"Best place for it," grunted Sir Geoffrey
unsympathetically.  "I'll pay the interest
for you next year, if you'll agree to leave it
there."
</p>

<p>
Melville clenched his fists and walked on
in silence for a few yards.
</p>

<p>
"You don't mind helping Ralph," he said,
with a sneer; "he's so different, isn't he?"
</p>

<p>
"That is my own affair," Sir Geoffrey said,
"but I don't mind saying I've never had to
refuse him, because he has never asked me.
He's a thoroughly fine fellow."
</p>

<p>
"He's a humbug," said Melville.  "He's
not above borrowing from me at all events.
As you insist upon knowing what I did with
the last two hundred and fifty I had from
you, I will tell you that I gave Ralph a
hundred of it."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe you," said Sir Geoffrey.
"You're a liar, Melville, and I've proved it."
</p>

<p>
"Read that," said Melville shortly.
</p>

<p>
He took Ralph's letter out of his pocket
and gave it to his uncle, who read it in the
fading light.  A spasm of pain crossed the
old man's face, but he drew himself up with
dignity.
</p>

<p>
"I detected you in one lie, sir," he said,
"but I may have made a mistake about this.
If so, I apologise.  You did what your
brother asked you?  Sent him this hundred
pounds?"
</p>

<p>
Melville met his keen eyes steadily.
</p>

<p>
"I did.  I sent it to him at once."
</p>

<p>
"How?  By cheque?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Melville; "in notes&mdash;twenty
fivers."  His wonted effrontery returned to
him.  "I can tell you the numbers if you
like."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, no," replied Sir Geoffrey.
"I'm not proposing to try to trace the notes
now, and Ralph can give me his own
explanation of his temporary embarrassment
later.  Come to the house and I will repay
you for him now."
</p>

<p>
Melville's heart beat rapidly with excitement.
He felt absolutely no shame at his
fraud, no fear of the subsequent inevitable
exposure.  He had to get money somehow,
and with incredible swiftness it was already
almost in his grasp.  They walked in silence
to the Manor House.  As they passed the
drawing-room windows Melville caught sight
of Gwendolen Austen's figure and involuntarily
paused, but Sir Geoffrey noticed the
action and harshly interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. and Miss Austen are staying here
as my guests.  As this is purely a business
visit on your part we will, if you please, go
to my library," and he strode along the
terrace.
</p>

<p>
Melville followed him, and turning to the
right came to the west front of the house,
on which side lay Sir Geoffrey's private set
of rooms.  To Melville, overwrought with
excitement as he was, the library with its
great armchairs and well-filled bookcases
looked very homelike and comfortable, but
he did not venture to sit down unasked, and
Sir Geoffrey pointedly refrained from everything
approaching hospitality.  He unlocked
a drawer in his writing table and, taking out
his cheque book, filled in a form payable to
Melville for one hundred pounds.  Before
signing the cheque, he laid down his pen and
looked scrutinisingly at his nephew.
</p>

<p>
"There are a few things I wish to say to
you, Melville," he said very slowly, "before
we finally part, and I beg you to remember
them, as they may prevent any future
misunderstanding.  For more than thirty years
I have treated you as my son, in spite of
endless disappointments at your total failure
to give me any return in consideration or
affection.  You have always been utterly
selfish, and, as I think, utterly bad.  Now I
am a rich man, and you may perhaps argue
that I am only anticipating the provision I
have doubtless made for you in my will.
Please understand that that is not the case.
Over and above the just expenses of your life
up to now you have already had from me
many thousand pounds, which have been
squandered by you in wanton vice.  I do not
intend you to have any more.  I hold that
my money was given to me for some other
purpose than that.  In point of fact, I have
not made my will, but when I choose to do
so, you will not be a legatee.  You
understand perfectly?"
</p>

<p>
Melville bowed.
</p>

<p>
"Very good.  Now I am giving you this
cheque because for once you have done an
unselfish action and have lent your brother
two-fifths of what you had reason to suppose
was the last money you would ever receive
from me.  I am very, very sorry Ralph asked
you for it, but very glad you sent it to him.
I repay you on his behalf, and will see that
he in turn repays me."
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey signed the cheque and gave
it to Melville.
</p>

<p>
"I have left it open so that you may
obtain the money in the morning.  This, too,
is your property," and he gave him Ralph's
letter, which Melville had forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Then Sir Geoffrey rose.
</p>

<p>
"This is a final parting, Melville," he said
solemnly, "and I wish to heaven it were not
so.  If in these last few weeks I had any
reason to hope you had been trying to be a
better man I might have been more harsh
to-night, but not so relentless.  But the
money I gave you the other day, apart from
this hundred pounds, has gone in gambling
as all the rest has gone, and as everything
else I might give you would go.  And I
declare now, upon my word of honour as a
gentleman, that I hold myself free of you at
last.  From whatever you may do in the
future to bring shame upon your family I,
in their name, declare we are absolved, and
you must look for no more help or countenance
from us.  And now I will ask you to go.
You can walk to the station, and will not
have long to wait for a train to town."
</p>

<p>
And opening the French windows on to
the lawn, Sir Geoffrey stood with set lips and
stern eyes until his nephew disappeared
among the shrubbery that fringed the drive.
</p>

<p>
Outside, Melville drew a deep breath.
</p>

<p>
"The hysterical old idiot!" he said, half
audibly; but his fingers trembled as he
placed the cheque in his inner pocket, and
he was more nervous than he thought himself
capable of being.  "Still, I've got a hundred
pounds, and as for the row which, I suppose,
is bound to follow when the old man finds
out the truth&mdash;that can rip for the present.
I'm glad he didn't cross the cheque.  There
wouldn't have been much change out of it
for me if I'd had to pay it into my account,
because I'm so overdrawn, and, what's more,
it might be stopped if Ralph turned up early
to-morrow.  Gad!  I'll go to the bank at
nine."
</p>

<p>
He stumbled along until he reached the
station.  He had another stiff glass of spirits
at the refreshment bar, and found he had
only a shilling left.
</p>

<p>
"Good thing I took a return ticket," he
muttered, "and as for to-morrow I can go
to the bank in a cab, thank goodness, and
go home in a balloon, if I choose.  And after
that, I'll clear out of town for a bit and pull
myself together&mdash;and pull myself together."
</p>

<p>
He laughed stupidly as he found himself
repeating his words, and then huddled up in
a corner of the carriage.  How he got back
to his chambers in Jermyn Street he scarcely
knew, but he had been there some time
before his attention was attracted by a letter
which was lying on his table.  It was written
in a hand that was not familiar to him.  It
bore date that morning, and the paper was
stamped with a monogram and the address,
5, The Vale, South Kensington.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Dear Mr. Melville Ashley," it ran, "there
are many reasons&mdash;into none of which do I
deem it expedient to enter now&mdash;why I have
hitherto refrained from inviting you to my
house.  For the moment I will confine myself
to making the announcement, for which you
may be wholly unprepared, that I married
Sir Geoffrey Holt many years ago, and am,
consequently, your aunt by marriage.  I
shall be obliged if you will call upon me
to-morrow at half-past four o'clock, and it is
my desire that until I have seen you, you
shall not acquaint any third person with the
contents of this communication.&mdash;I am, yours
faithfully, LAVINIA HOLT."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
At last the full significance of the note was
borne in upon him.
</p>

<p>
"Married Sir Geoffrey many years ago!"
Melville said slowly.  "Strange! that is
very strange!"
</p>

<p>
He entered the address in his pocket book,
and then carefully locked away the letter,
together with that from Ralph, in a despatch box.
</p>

<p>
"In spite of all you said, Sir Geoffrey, I
fancy this letter, too, may mean money in
my pocket!" and the smile upon his face
was very evil.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
MEDIATION.
</h3>

<p>
Breakfast is a period of probation for many
people's temper.  It is a comparatively easy
matter after dinner in the evening to assume
light spirits with one's evening dress, knowing
that the work and worries of the day are all
behind one, but considerable philosophy is
required to be entirely amiable the first thing
in the morning, when the same work and
worries have to be taken up anew.
</p>

<p>
So when, the morning following Melville's
surprise visit to the Manor House, Sir Geoffrey
entered the dining-room, Gwendolen's loving
eyes perceived at once that something had
occurred to ruffle his equanimity.  With her
he was never irritable, but his greeting was
absent-minded, and he seemed to seek in
vain for anything to interest him in the
columns of the <i>Times</i>.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Austen usually breakfasted in bed,
and as Ralph was not to return until the
middle of the day, Sir Geoffrey and Gwendolen
were alone together, and the meal passed
almost in silence.  At last Sir Geoffrey
himself appeared to become aware of the fact
that he was discharging his duties as a host
with something less than his usual success.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me, Gwen," he said pleasantly.
"I'm an old bear this morning, and poor
company for my beautiful princess."
</p>

<p>
Gwendolen rose and put her arms round
his neck.
</p>

<p>
"Then if the story books are to be believed,
the beautiful Princess only has to kiss the
old bear, and he will be transformed into
Prince Charming again," and leaning over
him she kissed him affectionately.
</p>

<p>
"You're a little witch," said Sir Geoffrey,
smiling; "but tell me, aren't you burning to
know what has upset my temper to-day?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," Gwendolen answered quickly,
"unless it is anything that I have done."
</p>

<p>
"Of course it isn't," said Sir Geoffrey;
"but it's the next thing to it.  I've got a
bone to pick with Ralph."
</p>

<p>
Gwendolen's face clouded over.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I am sorry," she said, but almost
immediately her eyes shone brightly again.
"It can't be very serious, though, because
he's sure to have some perfectly satisfactory
explanation for whatever he has done, and
as soon as you see him you'll find there's no
bone to pick."
</p>

<p>
"You're a loyal little woman," said Sir
Geoffrey, well pleased, "and I've no doubt
you're right.  What time is the immaculate
hero to honour us by his reappearance?"
</p>

<p>
"About a quarter to one," Gwendolen replied.
</p>

<p>
"In time for luncheon," Sir Geoffrey
remarked.  "Whatever one may think about
his other meritorious qualities, there can be
no doubt about the excellence of Ralph's
appetite."
</p>

<p>
"You're trying to draw me," said Gwendolen
cheerfully; "but I won't be drawn.
I like a man to have a good appetite, and,
by the way, you're not a bad trencherman
yourself."
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I've got some work to do this morning,"
he said as he got up.  "You must kill the
time somehow until Ralph returns, and after
luncheon you will be able to pick water lilies
and gaze into each other's eyes to any extent.
Are you going to meet him at the station?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought of doing so," Gwendolen admitted.
</p>

<p>
"Did you really!" said Sir Geoffrey, with
affected incredulity.  "Well, I don't want
to interfere with your plans, but seriously,
Gwen, as soon as you've got over the shock&mdash;I
mean the rapture&mdash;of seeing him again,
will you tell him to come to me in the
library?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I will," said Gwendolen, "and
seriously, too, dear uncle, I'm sure everything
will be cleared up as soon as you see him."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay it will," Sir Geoffrey agreed,
"but I have always believed in getting to
the bottom of things immediately.  When
you're married, Gwen, avoid a misunderstanding
with your husband as you would
avoid the devil.  Quarrel if you must, but,
at any rate, know what you're quarrelling
about.  That's good advice."
</p>

<p>
"How can an old bachelor give any good
advice about the married state?" Gwendolen
asked lightly, and she nodded gaily as she
ran upstairs, not noticing how the expression
altered on Sir Geoffrey's face.
</p>

<p>
"Blows beneath the heart dealt by those
one loves the most," he muttered sadly.
"Well, it's inevitable in this world, I suppose,
and, after all, there's compensation in the
love itself.  But Ralph ought not to have
stooped to borrow that money from Melville;
and what on earth can he have wanted it
for that he was afraid to ask me?  That's
the sting," and the old gentleman walked
slowly to his library and shut himself in
there alone.
</p>

<p>
Both to Sir Geoffrey and to Gwendolen the
morning seemed to drag, but at last the
train which brought Ralph from town arrived,
and, heedless of the bystanders, Gwendolen
kissed her lover and walked down the hill
with him to the river.
</p>

<p>
"Had a happy morning, dear?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"A very long one," Gwendolen replied.
"Time is very inconsiderate to people who
are in love; it flies when they are together
and halts when they are alone, whereas, of
course, it ought to do exactly the reverse."
</p>

<p>
"Of course it ought," Ralph assented,
"but, anyhow, it's ripping to be alive.  By
Jove, Gwen, I think I'm the happiest man
in the whole world."
</p>

<p>
Gwen looked at him critically.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure you are the nicest," she said
enthusiastically, and did not demur to his
finding her approval an excuse for another kiss.
</p>

<p>
"Let's go on the houseboat," he said,
"and after luncheon I will punt you up to
where the water lilies are."
</p>

<p>
"Pick water lilies and gaze in each other's
eyes," said Gwen, laughing; "that was the
programme Sir Geoffrey mapped out for us.
Oh!  I forgot.  He asked me to send you to
him directly you arrived.  He's in the library."
</p>

<p>
"Can't it keep till after luncheon?" Ralph
asked indifferently.  "I want to talk to you."
</p>

<p>
"No," Gwen replied; "you must go now.
I promised that you would.  He said he had
a bone to pick with you."
</p>

<p>
"Did he?" said Ralph.  "I wonder what's
the matter."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," Gwen answered, "but he
was very quiet at breakfast, and I guessed
there was something wrong; then he told
me it was about you, and I said you could
explain anything you did or didn't do, and
you've got to go at once and do so."
</p>

<p>
"A very lucid statement," Ralph said,
smiling.  "Well, it's a bore to have to leave
you at once, but if you've promised, there's
no help for it."
</p>

<p>
"None," said Gwendolen gravely.  "Come
along, Ralph."
</p>

<p>
In her heart she was a little uneasy, for
although she had absolute confidence in
Ralph's perfect integrity, she had never
before seen Sir Geoffrey look so troubled at
anything in which his favourite nephew was
concerned.  But she stifled her not
unnatural curiosity, and, leaving Ralph at the
library door, ran off to the room where her
mother was writing wholly unnecessary letters.
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey was so engrossed in a book
that he did not hear Ralph come into the
room.  Comfortably ensconced in a huge
armchair, with spectacles on his nose, and
the sunlight streaming through the window
upon his silver hair, he embodied the general
idea of a cultivated old English gentleman.
Ralph looked at him, and then spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Gwendolen tells me you want to see me,
Uncle Geoffrey, so I've come straight in."
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey looked up.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said.  "Melville was here last night."
</p>

<p>
Ralph was vexed, for he knew what was
the usual reason for his brother's visits to
Fairbridge.
</p>

<p>
"Was he?" he said.  "I didn't know he
was back."
</p>

<p>
"Then you knew he was going abroad?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," said Ralph.  "He made no
secret about it to me."
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey only grunted, and Ralph went on.
</p>

<p>
"In many ways I'm rather sorry for
Melville, uncle.  Of course, I know he has
been a lot of worry to you, but he's my
brother after all, and it isn't easy to get the
sort of work that he could do."
</p>

<p>
"He's had a good education," said Sir
Geoffrey, "and he's got good health and a
pair of hands.  What more does a man need
to earn an honest living?"
</p>

<p>
Ralph was very happy, and when one is
happy it is difficult not to feel generously
disposed even to those one loves the least;
so now he championed his brother quite
sincerely.
</p>

<p>
"I've got all that, too," he said, but Sir
Geoffrey put up his hand in deprecation of
any comparison between the two brothers.
</p>

<p>
"You owe me a hundred pounds, Ralph,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"My dear uncle," Ralph replied.  "I owe
you a great deal more than that.  I can never
repay you a fraction of what I owe you."
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey's face lighted up with pleasure
at the young fellow's frank expression of
gratitude.
</p>

<p>
"One does not repay free gifts," he
answered.  "Let all that pass; but, Ralph,
why couldn't you tell me you were in need
of ready money?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't quite understand," said Ralph,
looking puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"A few weeks ago," said Sir Geoffrey,
rather testily, "you borrowed it from
Melville, and I repaid him for you last night."
</p>

<p>
Ralph's face flushed with indignation.
</p>

<p>
"You paid Melville a hundred pounds for me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said his uncle.
</p>

<p>
"But I don't owe him anything."
</p>

<p>
"You wrote to him at Monte Carlo, and
asked him for a hundred pounds.  What did
you want that for?"
</p>

<p>
"To complete the purchase of the yacht
for Gwendolen.  I wanted to give it to her
absolutely unencumbered.  Mr. Tracy was
selling some capital for me and said I must
wait till the following settling day for the
cash, and I asked Melville to lend me the
hundred I needed until the matter was
completed.  But he didn't send it.  He
never even answered my letter."
</p>

<p>
"He tells me he sent you a hundred pounds
in notes," Sir Geoffrey said distinctly.  "Isn't
that true?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Ralph indignantly; "it's an
absolute lie."  He paced the room in angry
impatience.  It seemed incredible that his
own brother could be capable of such an
utterly unworthy trick.  Sir Geoffrey closed
his book with a snap and pressed his lips
together.
</p>

<p>
"I ought to have known you both better,"
he said; "but Melville's story was so
circumstantial, and there was the evidence of your
letter, too.  I was completely taken in.
But now I know what to do."
</p>

<p>
Ralph stopped abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Instruct Tracy to take proceedings
against Melville for getting money under
false pretences."
</p>

<p>
"But that's punishable with imprisonment,"
said Ralph aghast.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly it is," said Sir Geoffrey grimly.
</p>

<p>
"But you can't make a convict of my
brother, and your nephew!"
</p>

<p>
"Our relationship to him is our
misfortune," said Sir Geoffrey, "not our fault.
I shall do what I say."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Uncle Geoffrey," said Ralph
excitedly, "after all, this is largely my affair.
I will give you back the hundred pounds&mdash;I've
got the money now&mdash;and I will go to
town at once and square accounts with
Melville.  Did he tell you where he was
staying?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said his uncle; "I did not enquire."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm sure to get news of him at
Jermyn Street, if he isn't actually there.
Promise to abandon all idea of prosecution,
and leave this in my hands.  Promise?"
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey looked with pleasure at his
nephew as he stood erect before him, glowing
with just indignation, but with chivalrous
desire to spare his brother this crowning
shame.
</p>

<p>
"How you two fellows are brothers passes
my comprehension," he said.  "Well, Ralph,
I tell you what I will do.  I'll give you a
week&mdash;you need not go up to town again
to-day, for that would be hard on Gwen.
I'll give you a week, and if you can make
Melville disgorge the money I'll take it back
with uncommon satisfaction.  If you fail, I
reserve liberty of action."
</p>

<p>
"That's fair, I suppose," said Ralph
reluctantly; then he added more hopefully,
"but it will be all right; of course, it will
be all right."
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey shook his head doubtfully,
but the mellow roar of the gong reverberated
through the house announcing luncheon, and
he welcomed the interruption.
</p>

<p>
"Shake hands, my boy," he said.  "I'm
sorry I misjudged you, even for a moment.
And now come along, or Gwen will think I've
frightened away your appetite."
</p>

<p>
He linked his arm within his nephew's,
and went into the dining-room with all his
wonted cheerfulness restored.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
KINDRED AND AFFINITY.
</h3>

<p>
Possession of money has an invigorating
effect upon the majority of people, and
Melville, who like most gamblers lived only
in the present, awoke in the morning feeling
a new man because of the open cheque for
£100 which he had secured the night before.
No qualms of conscience disturbed his
equanimity because of the device he had adopted
to obtain it.  As soon as his toilette and
breakfast were completed he could get the
money from the bank, and the future, with
its difficulties and complications, might be
left to take care of itself.  The solid
satisfaction derived from the possession of money
was enough for the moment.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, to-day contained an element of
surprise in the shape of his pending visit to
his unknown relative, and next to money
there is probably nothing that has so much
charm for the average gambler as the element
of surprise, had any kindred spirit been
with him at the time Melville would have
made wagers upon the age and appearance
of this Lady Holt, of whose existence he had
never heard before.  She was old, of course,
and most likely intensely disagreeable;
incompatibility of temper was doubtless the
reason of her separation from Sir Geoffrey,
and desire to avoid scandal the explanation
of her complete seclusion from the world.
The phrasing of her letter showed that she
was precise, and upon that fragmentary
piece of evidence Melville erected in imagination
a complete living personality, in much
the same way as scientists "restore" an
entire prehistoric mammoth from a single
tooth.
</p>

<p>
He dressed with particular care, and after
an early breakfast went cheerfully downstairs
and drove to his uncle's bank.  Then,
with eighteen five-pound notes in his pocket
book and ten pounds in cash in his waistcoat,
he was in a position to spend in a sufficiently
agreeable manner the hours that intervened
before he was due at South Kensington.
</p>

<p>
A refresher, in the shape of a sherry and
bitters at the club, was followed by a delicate
but entirely adequate luncheon at the Dieu-donnée,
and Melville's enjoyment of it was
not diminished by the fact that, happening to
meet a casual acquaintance there, he lunched
at the same table, and suggested that they
should toss to decide which of the twain
should pay the joint account, with the result
that the casual acquaintance lost.  Evidently
the fickle jade was smiling on Melville; a
couple of games of billiards followed the
luncheon, and another refresher the billiards,
and in high good humour Melville sauntered
down the Ladies' Mile, preparatory to driving
from Albert Gate to The Vale.
</p>

<p>
Opposite the French Embassy he parted
from his friend.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry I can't ask you to come with me,
old man," he said genially, "but I'm obliged
to pay a duty visit to an aged aunt."
</p>

<p>
The friend expressed his sincere
commiseration, but Melville only laughed.
</p>

<p>
"It's a very little flaw in an otherwise
perfect day.  You must lunch with me next
time, and I will give you your revenge at
billiards," and carefully choosing a
well-appointed hansom he drove away.
</p>

<p>
The Vale, South Kensington, is a little-known
<i>cul-de-sac</i> lying just off the Fulham
Road.  It contains but half-a-dozen houses,
with trim lawns in front and quite large
gardens in the rear; great elms shade the
houses, and the remoteness from the main
road makes them very quiet; in all of them
are French windows and small verandahs, and
there is an air of quietude and refinement
about the place that makes it very attractive.
</p>

<p>
"The old lady does herself pretty well,"
thought Melville to himself as he walked up
the gravelled path and noticed the
close-cropped lawn and the blaze of geraniums and
petunias.  "I wonder what she knows about
me, and what line I'd better take!  The
interesting musician might be diplomatic
perhaps."
</p>

<p>
He thought that the maid who opened
the door looked curiously at him as he
enquired whether Lady Holt was at home,
but, after all, that was a trifling matter,
capable of bearing many interpretations.  His
interest was, however, more fully aroused by
the drawing-room into which he was shown
to await his aunt's coming, for it was not at
all the sort of environment in which he had
imagined he would find Sir Geoffrey's wife.
It was essentially the drawing-room of a
worldly woman of the world, furnished with
taste, but evidently at great cost; photographs
and silver boxes, enamels and ivories
were scattered in profusion over the many
tables, water colours by rising artists covered
the walls, cushions and flowers were everywhere.
</p>

<p>
"I shall have to readjust my preconceived
notions of my elderly relative," he said to
himself as he took a rapid survey of the
pretty room; "this is a veritable canary's
cage."
</p>

<p>
Then the door opened, and at the rustle of
silk petticoats he turned to make a formal
bow to his aunt.  But as he turned, an
exclamation of surprise escaped his lips and
his single eye-glass dropped upon the floor,
for the woman who entered was no precise
and ringletted old lady, but the one who had
asked him for his card at Monte Carlo, and
who had expressed such sympathy with him
when he was reduced to the necessity of
applying for the <i>viaticum</i>.  It was indeed no
other than the charming Mrs. Sinclair.
</p>

<p>
She came forward with perfect self-possession,
but a gleam of amusement lurked
in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"This is really a most astonishing
experience," Melville said, as he bowed over
her hand.  "You are quite the last person
I expected to see."
</p>

<p>
"Not the last you wanted to see, I hope,"
she replied, "but I confess delight is not the
predominant expression upon your face at
the moment.  Won't you sit down?"
</p>

<p>
Melville picked up his monocle and polished
it carefully before readjusting it in his eye.
</p>

<p>
"But tell me," he persisted, "what are
you doing here?"
</p>

<p>
"Living here," Mrs. Sinclair answered.
"What else do you suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't quite sort things," Melville said
apologetically.  "To begin with, you see, I
had never heard until last night that there
was a Lady Holt, and when I got her note
asking me to call here to-day I tried to
picture what she would be like."
</p>

<p>
"What was the result of your efforts?"
Mrs. Sinclair enquired.
</p>

<p>
Melville laughed slightly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm bound to admit that I imagined
my uncle's choice in women would be early
Victorian, so to speak, and I don't think it's
anything but a compliment to say that the
early Victorian brand isn't very likely to
agree with you.  If you like Lady Holt,
there is hope for me."
</p>

<p>
"I like her very much," Mrs. Sinclair said.
"Mr. Melville, it isn't quite fair, perhaps, to
lay snares for young men, and you evidently
don't grasp the situation.  You remember
your last night at Monte Carlo?"
</p>

<p>
"It was not the sort of night to forget
readily," Melville replied grimly.  "I never
had such monstrous bad luck at the tables
before."
</p>

<p>
"You gave me one of your cards and I
promised to write to you."
</p>

<p>
"You did," said Melville.
</p>

<p>
"I have kept my promise," said Mrs. Sinclair.
"I wrote to you yesterday and
asked you to come to see me.  I am Lady
Holt."
</p>

<p>
The astonishment depicted on Melville's
face was ludicrous, and Mrs. Sinclair rippled
over with mirth.
</p>

<p>
"I never thought to see you so taken
aback," she said.  "What I like so much
about English gentlemen is that they are so
imperturbable, and now you are gazing at
me as if I were a freak."
</p>

<p>
"Really, I beg your pardon," Melville said.
"but to think how grossly I have misjudged
Sir Geoffrey!"
</p>

<p>
"Come, that's much better," Mrs. Sinclair
replied.  "Yes, Mr. Ashley, the confession
has to be made; I am your aunt."
</p>

<p>
"I'm uncommonly delighted to hear it,"
Melville said heartily, "and I've only one
regret in learning the fact."
</p>

<p>
"And that is&mdash;&mdash;?" his new-found relative
enquired.
</p>

<p>
"That I did not know it long ago,"
Melville replied.  His wonted composure
returned, and with it his wonted desire to
stand well in the opinion of those in whose
company he happened to be&mdash;a desire, it
may be said, characteristic of many men who
drift into bad lives from weakness rather
than from natural vice.  "Tell me, have you
refrained from claiming relationship with me
all this time because you heard I was a bad
lot?"
</p>

<p>
"I perceive you are not expert in drawing
inferences," Mrs. Sinclair said; "one does
not associate the particularly goody-goody
type of young man with Monte Carlo, and
that is where I saw you first."
</p>

<p>
"That is true," Melville admitted.  "I
must plead guilty to not being goody-goody.
By the way, am I to call you 'aunt'?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sinclair shuddered.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," she said emphatically;
"there is no necessity to draw public
attention to the question of my age."
</p>

<p>
"What am I to call you?" he persisted.
</p>

<p>
"Call me Mrs. Sinclair," she said.  "How
old are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Thirty-five," Melville answered.  "Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Then you are old enough to call me
Lavender when we are alone," she said.
"Out of doors it had better be Mrs. Sinclair,
I suppose.  It is a censorious world."
</p>

<p>
She leaned back in her chair and surveyed
her nephew critically; the scrutiny was
satisfactory, and she was glad of the impulse
that had prompted her to disclose her identity
to him.  Yet, shrewd and clever woman as
she was, she had taken a step which, while it
could never be retraced, was the first towards
the undoing of them both.  There were other
things in her life which in her hours of
reflection she regretted, not least among them
being her separation from a husband whose
good qualities she fully recognised, but
nothing in the past had been so fraught with
peril to herself as this alliance with her
husband's nephew, which she owed to a
single moment of caprice.
</p>

<p>
"Confess now," she said presently, "you
are burning with curiosity to know all about
everything?"
</p>

<p>
"That is a comprehensive way of putting
it," he laughed, "but it is true.  Tell me
everything that is necessary, and as much
more as you think fit."
</p>

<p>
"The only thing that is necessary," Mrs. Sinclair
replied, "is that I actually am Sir
Geoffrey Holt's wife.  I married him years
ago, when I was too young to realise all that
marriage means, especially marriage to a
man many years older than oneself.  And&mdash;it
didn't answer.  That is really all."  She
had no intention of telling Melville very
much about herself, and, of course, he could
not cross-examine her.  "He had not come
into the title then," she went on, "and indeed
there was no reason for supposing he ever
would, for his brother was quite young
enough to have married and had sons.
Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"  She paused, and Melville took
advantage of the pause to give expression to
the thought that was uppermost in his mind.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder that his marriage has been so
completely forgotten.  I never heard of it,
and I'm quite sure my brother never has, yet
he has been like a son to Sir Geoffrey, and
knows a lot about his affairs."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sinclair flushed a little.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Geoffrey is a very proud man.  He
always was; indeed, that had a great deal
to do with our mutual incompatibility, and
proud men are apt to hold their tongues
about their failures.  Oh, yes!" she said,
laughing, though there was no mirth in her
laughter, "it was a dismal failure, and so we
agreed to separate and never trouble each
other again."
</p>

<p>
"And you never have?" said Melville.
</p>

<p>
"We never have."
</p>

<p>
"Sir Geoffrey is a very rich man," Melville
remarked, following the line of his own
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"I believe he is," said Mrs. Sinclair
indifferently.  "All the money in the world
doesn't make some things worth while."
</p>

<p>
"But I suppose he is very generous to you?"
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't touch a penny of his money,"
said Mrs. Sinclair vehemently.
</p>

<p>
Melville, of course, dropped the subject,
but noted her reply for future use.  What
he wanted to ascertain most at the moment
was Lady Holt's feeling for her husband, but
she gave him no opportunity.
</p>

<p>
"What's your brother like?" she enquired.
"Anything like you?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," said Melville shortly.  "Ralph
is a paragon of all the virtues and I'm&mdash;not."
</p>

<p>
"And he's like a son to Sir Geoffrey?"
said Mrs. Sinclair.  "Is he to be his heir?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," Melville answered moodily.
"I suppose so; but, as a matter of fact, Sir
Geoffrey hasn't made his will, so I don't
know what he will do with his money."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sinclair yawned.  The conversation
really did not interest her much, and she had
her own reasons for not wishing to let it get
too intimate.  She had taken a fancy to
Melville when she first saw him in the Riviera;
he belonged to the type of man in whose
company she was most at home, and she
foresaw a certain amount of pleasurable
excitement in which she could participate
with him without being worried by
demonstrations of a more affectionate interest,
which men not related to her were apt to
make.  A nephew is safer than a cousin.
</p>

<p>
"You must ask me to dine with you," she
said, "and we will develop our acquaintance
gradually.  I hate finding out all about
people at once and having nothing left to
learn."
</p>

<p>
"Dine with me to-night," said Melville
promptly.  The hundred pounds were burning
a hole in his pocket, and he felt convinced
that more would be forthcoming now from
the same source.  "Where shall it be?"
</p>

<p>
"Wherever you like," Mrs. Sinclair replied.
"I'm always interested in people's varying
ideas of hospitality.  Come here for me at
half-past seven and take me to the appointed
place.  Only don't tell me now where it
is to be."
</p>

<p>
"All right," said Melville with alacrity.
He liked her point of view and felt amazingly
sympathetic already.  Moreover, he recognised
as clearly as she did the value of their
relationship as a preventative of mutual
misunderstandings.  "I will go and fix it up.
'Pon my honour, I'm awfully delighted
about this."
</p>

<p>
"Respect my confidence," she said gravely.
"I may rely on that?"
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely," he answered.  "I never
interfere with other people's private business.
It's not my form; and, besides, I'm so
grateful to you for recognising me that I'm
not going to forfeit a good thing."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sinclair was satisfied.  She rang the
bell for the maid to open the door, and smiled
graciously upon her nephew.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you're going to be a great success,"
she said, as he rose to go.  "There is an
element of romance in the way fate has
brought us together that is fascinating, and
really you are a very creditable nephew."
</p>

<p>
Melville smiled sardonically.  His aunt's
husband held such a different opinion!
</p>

<p>
"I am a particularly fortunate one, I
think," was all he said, and as he went out
into the Fulham Road he thought the sun
had never shone so brightly.  Fortune had
turned her wheel again, and his gambler's
soul exulted.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap06"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
BRAVADO.
</h3>

<p>
It was, indeed, with a very similar sense of
satisfaction to that enjoyed by a man who,
when playing cut-throat euchre, finds the
joker in his hand, that Melville contemplated
the advent of Mrs. Sinclair into his life.  In
many respects she was a charming woman;
vigorous and resourceful in consequence of
her somewhat adventurous career, but
womanly and free from affectation.  Moreover,
if she could not claim entire exoneration
from the charge of being an adventuress, she
was entitled to several important limitations
in the term; she gambled, it is true, and
led an extravagant life, but she did both out
of her own resources, and did not prey upon
society as do most of the evening-gowned
frequenters of the Casino.  What other
skeletons might be hidden in the secret
cupboard of her life, Melville did not yet trouble
to surmise; he assumed that among them
was the grisly relic of her marriage with his
uncle.  The marriage had been a failure;
the couple had separated and agreed to let
the story be forgotten; "Sinclair" was
merely a <i>nom-de-guerre</i>, and everything was
capable of a perfectly satisfactory explanation,
with the exception of her financial
independence.  Melville could not
understand the feeling which prompted her to
refuse assistance from her husband, more
especially in such a case as this, where she
might dictate her own terms for consenting
to suppress the fact of her existence.  What
her motive was in so doing was one of the
first things Melville intended to ascertain;
there might be money in the knowledge.
But the first thing he intended to do was to
tell Sir Geoffrey that he knew this amazing
secret of the marriage, for he felt convinced
that he could make money by holding his
tongue on that subject to the world at large.
</p>

<p>
Such were the thoughts that passed through
Melville's mind as he walked from the station
to The Grange at Fairbridge, where the
Austens lived.  With him to decide was to
act, and the previous night he had resolved
to adopt a bold policy and face Sir Geoffrey
and Ralph at once; they had had time to
compare notes about the hundred pounds,
and a stormy interview with them both was
inevitable, but it possessed no terrors for
Melville now.  He guessed correctly that for
the credit of the family neither of them
would detail the facts to the Austens, with
whom he was particularly anxious to stand
well.  Too selfish a man to be capable of
real love for any woman, he yet liked
Gwendolen better than any other woman he had
ever seen, and he was quite willing to "range
himself" if she would be his wife.  That she
was engaged to his brother troubled him
very little.  Engagements had been broken
off before now, and the idea of cutting Ralph
out had a certain piquancy that rendered the
attempt worth making.
</p>

<p>
Looking delightfully cool and well-bred in
his grey flannel suit and straw hat, with a
turn-down collar that seemed to suggest an
innocent simplicity of character, Melville
walked slowly down the hill from the station
and presented himself at the Austens' door.
The ladies were in the garden, the servant
informed him, and there Melville sought them,
confident of a friendly greeting from them both.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Austen was unaffectedly glad to see
him.  She had a tolerant feeling for nearly
all young men, and Melville's marvellous
gift as a musician had an especial charm for
her.  To Gwendolen he was Ralph's brother,
and hitherto Ralph had championed Melville's
cause, with the result that the girl
was disposed to regard him as a somewhat
maligned young man.  So to-day they made
much of him, and, under the influence of
their warm welcome and gentle refinement,
Melville was at his best.
</p>

<p>
"I've been sowing wild oats at Monte
Carlo," he said gently, "and I found it
vanity.  So I've come home.  No, I had no
adventures and met nobody I knew.  I lost
all my money, and I'm very sorry for myself."
</p>

<p>
He congratulated Gwendolen on her
engagement to Ralph, and there was a touch of
pathos in his voice that proved him to be a
consummate actor.  Altogether, he enjoyed
himself hugely, and awaited the critical
moment of meeting his brother with actual
pleasure.  Ralph was expected early in the
afternoon, and Melville lunched at the Grange
and occupied the centre of its little stage
with much complacency.
</p>

<p>
After luncheon Gwendolen remained indoors
to watch for Ralph, and Melville sat
in the verandah with Mrs. Austen and waxed
confidential.  She liked to be regarded as
the recipient of the confidences of young men,
and Melville played upon her amiable weakness,
being careful to invent such peccadilloes
only as would not strain her charity unduly.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven divides its gifts very unequally,"
he remarked presently.
</p>

<p>
"Why that platitude?" asked Mrs. Austen.
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking of Ralph and myself," he
said.  "Of course, Sir Geoffrey has been
equally generous to us both, but I notice
that Ralph gets all the affection.  He was
always Uncle Geoffrey's favourite, and now
he is engaged to Gwen."  He sighed pathetically,
and Mrs. Austen considered.
</p>

<p>
"I think your uncle is just as fond of you
as he is of Ralph," she said, "but you're not
a home bird and your brother is.  Really,
I don't think Sir Geoffrey could have been
kinder to you if you had been his own son."
</p>

<p>
"Not kinder," Melville said, "but fonder,
more affectionate.  You have known him a
long time, Mrs. Austen.  Why do you suppose
he never married?"
</p>

<p>
"I have often wondered," Mrs. Austen
said, "but I never met him until he came
into the title and estates, and he was not a
young man then.  He may never have wanted
to marry, or he may have had some
disappointment.  At all events, it's an excellent
thing for you boys that he never did."
</p>

<p>
"Excellent," Melville assented heartily.
Mrs. Austen evidently had no suspicion of the
facts; that meant that Sir Geoffrey did not want
her to know them, and that, too, was excellent.
"Ah! here comes Ralph, dancing on air."
</p>

<p>
Judging by the expression on Ralph's face,
dancing on air was a disagreeable mode of
progression.  He was, indeed, furious at
finding Melville thus established in the heart of
the citadel; he was conscious, too, of a
disadvantage in being thus taken by surprise.
Confident in the justice of his indignation,
he could have invaded Melville's chambers
and demanded explanations and apologies
for the fraud; here all the force of his attack
would be wasted in the interval before he
could deliver it.
</p>

<p>
He made no offer to shake hands, and,
flushed with anger, he compared unfavourably
with Melville, sitting so imperturbable, and
prepared for all contingencies.
</p>

<p>
Melville employed every little artifice of
which he was capable to heighten the
contrast between his brother and himself, of
which he saw Mrs. Austen was conscious.
He made room for Ralph upon the verandah,
and chatted gaily of a hundred trifles, but to
all his flippancies Ralph returned only monosyllabic
answers, appearing awkward and ill-mannered
even in Gwendolen's biassed judgment.
</p>

<p>
At last Melville rose to go, and with alacrity
Ralph rose too.
</p>

<p>
Melville protested politely.
</p>

<p>
"Don't let me take you away, old man,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"But I want to have a talk with you,"
Ralph answered.
</p>

<p>
"Thought you weren't particularly pleased
to see me," Melville returned placidly, "but
I'm glad I was wrong.  Good-bye, Mrs. Austen,
and thanks awfully for a jolly time.
May I come again soon?"
</p>

<p>
"Do," she answered, "there's always cold
luncheon and a warm welcome here for you."  She
made the remark pointedly, for she was
a little vexed with Ralph.  She even went so
far as to restrain Gwendolen from accompanying
the brothers to the gate, and as they
disappeared at the end of the drive Ralph
was conscious of almost being in disgrace
with his future mother-in-law.
</p>

<p>
Outside, however, on the main road his
embarrassment vanished.
</p>

<p>
"What the deuce do you mean by coming
here like this?" he said angrily.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Ralph," said Melville coolly,
"The Grange doesn't belong to you, nor does
the Manor House&mdash;yet.  I've been to The
Grange because I wanted to see the Austens,
and now I'm going to the Manor House
because I want to see Sir Geoffrey."
</p>

<p>
Ralph was unfeignedly astonished.
</p>

<p>
"You want to see Sir Geoffrey?" he gasped.
</p>

<p>
"I do," said Melville.  "Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"I wonder you have the audacity to look
him in the face again," said Ralph hotly.
"You are a liar and a thief."
</p>

<p>
"Go slow, Ralph," said Melville, "go
slow.  It seems to me you're off your chump.
If your engagement hasn't turned your
brain, tell me what all this pother is about,
and leave mud-slinging till afterwards.  What
do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
Ralph was almost deceived by his brother's
calmness; at any rate, it had the effect of
making him struggle to regain command of
his own temper.
</p>

<p>
"I wrote to you when you were at Monte
Carlo," he said more quietly, "and asked
you to lend me a hundred pounds."
</p>

<p>
"That's so," said Melville.  "Sorry I
couldn't oblige you, but I didn't even read
your letter till I was on my way home, and
then I was broke myself."
</p>

<p>
"But you got a hundred pounds out of
Sir Geoffrey," spluttered Ralph.
</p>

<p>
"I did," said Melville.  "I hope you did
the same."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens, man!" cried Ralph, as
angrily as before; "don't try your vile
swindles on me too.  You told Sir Geoffrey
you lent me that hundred pounds and got
him to hand you over an open cheque for
the amount in repayment of what you said
was my debt, leaving him to get explanations
from me afterwards."
</p>

<p>
"I hope the old man wasn't very crusty,"
said Melville sweetly.
</p>

<p>
"But your whole story was an infernal
lie," roared Ralph, "and you got that money
by a vulgar, low-down swindle.  You are a
liar, Melville, and a thief.  I wish to heaven
Sir Geoffrey had kicked you out of the house
before he parted with the cheque."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay you do," Melville replied,
unmoved; "but really, Ralph, you've had
your whack out of the old buck, and now
you're going to marry the Austen money
you needn't grudge me a bit, need you?
It's not exactly brotherly."
</p>

<p>
The sneering affront goaded Ralph almost
to madness.
</p>

<p>
"You can thank me that you've not been
arrested already for getting that money
under false pretences," he said, livid with
passion.  "If Sir Geoffrey had had his own
way you would have been, and 'pon my word,
I'm beginning to be sorry I begged you off."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it isn't too late even yet," said
Melville, no less calmly than before, "but I
fancy you are exaggerating.  Sir Geoffrey is
always intemperate in his language, but I
can't believe he would adopt such extremely
unpleasant measures as the prosecution of
his own nephew.  However, I'll talk to him
about it.  I came down with the intention of
doing so after I left The Grange."
</p>

<p>
Ralph was nonplussed.  Such unlimited
assurance as that displayed by Melville was
outside his experience, and it even began to
have some effect upon him.
</p>

<p>
"I think it was a mean and dirty trick,"
he said, "to make out that I owed you
anything when I didn't, but that part of the
business you can settle with your own
conscience.  What are you going to do now
about the money?"
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?" Melville enquired
innocently.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Ralph, "I persuaded Sir
Geoffrey to drop the idea of legal proceedings
by saying that as you had used my name the
matter ought to be left in my hands.  I've
been to town to get the money, and I repaid
him this morning."
</p>

<p>
"That's really awfully good of you,"
Melville said effusively.  "I am infinitely
obliged to you, but I'm afraid I shall have
to owe it to you for a little while."
</p>

<p>
"It's simple waste of time to talk to you,"
said Ralph with scorn, "but there's one
more remark I have to make, and you may
as well remember it, for I mean what I say.
I can't undo the fact that you are my brother,
but I can do a good deal to prevent it from
being forced on my attention, and one way
is to avoid seeing you.  Now, in future I'll
trouble you to keep away from The Grange."
</p>

<p>
Melville coloured.  This was a contingency
he had not foreseen, and for a moment he
lost his judgment.
</p>

<p>
"Jealous, eh?" he enquired, with ill-affected
sarcasm.  He was no coward physically,
but he almost quailed before the blaze
in his brother's eyes.  Ralph did not trouble
to fling back the taunt.  With suppressed
passion he spoke rapidly and distinctly, and
each word flicked Melville on the raw.
</p>

<p>
"You are a contemptible swindler, and if
you only have rope enough you'll hang
yourself in the end.  I'm quits with Sir
Geoffrey over your last fraud, and it's worth
every penny of the money to have learnt
to know you as you are; but now I do know
you I'll take jolly good care that you don't
hang about my friends.  Sir Geoffrey has
ordered you out of the Manor House, and I
order you out of The Grange.  Go there again,
and I'll tell Mrs. Austen all about this business
and twist your neck into the bargain."
</p>

<p>
Melville forced a laugh.
</p>

<p>
"It will be time enough for you to order
me out of houses when you possess any.
When you are master of The Grange I shall
keep clear of the place, you may be sure.
Until then I shall call upon Mrs. Austen
whenever I choose."
</p>

<p>
"If you go to The Grange I shall tell
Mrs. Austen what has happened," Ralph repeated,
"and she will order you out then herself."
</p>

<p>
"I dare you to do it," said Melville.  In
reality the idea filled him with uneasiness,
but he was too shrewd to show it.  Instead,
he remarked reflectively, as if considering
Ralph's interests only, "Mrs. Austen might
begin to think she was allowing her daughter
to marry into a queer family, supposing for
the moment that she took everything you
said for gospel."
</p>

<p>
Ralph drove his hands deep into his
pockets.  Honesty such as his often seems
very stupid when confronted with the cleverness
of a knave, and he felt unequal to a
discussion with his brother.  But he wished
he had been less loyal to him in the past,
less sturdy an advocate for his defence
when Sir Geoffrey arraigned him.  It was
humiliating to think how completely Melville
had taken him in.  They walked in silence to the
Manor House, and Ralph paused by the gate.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to argue with you, and I
have nothing to add to what I said about The
Grange.  Go there and you'll see.  Here is
the Manor House.  If you take my advice
you will leave me here and get back to town
by the next train."
</p>

<p>
"When I ask your advice I'll consider
about taking it," Melville answered gently;
he saw how his own coolness angered and
flurried Ralph.  "As for The Grange,
Mrs. Austen has kindly invited me to dine there
and bring my violin, and I need scarcely say I
have accepted.  And as for Sir Geoffrey, I have
come down to see him, and if he's at home
I will see him now; if he is out I shall wait."
</p>

<p>
"You are beyond me," Ralph said hopelessly.
"Well, I don't want to keep you
away from Sir Geoffrey if you are anxious to
see him, but if I were in your shoes, which,
thank heaven, I am not, I would blow out
my brains rather than face him.  I don't
believe you have any shame left."
</p>

<p>
He opened the gate and, with Melville,
walked up the drive.  As they came in sight
of the house, however, his mind shrank from
the prospect of having to be present at so
painful an interview between his uncle and
brother as he felt sure this one must be.
He stopped abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"You will probably find Sir Geoffrey in
the library," he said.  "I am going down
to the houseboat."
</p>

<p>
"All right," said Melville unconcernedly.
"I dare say I shall see you again later.  If
Sir Geoffrey asks me to stay, I will.
By-bye," and noting with amusement the
incredulous surprise written on Ralph's
countenance he nodded cheerfully to him and
walked in through the open doorway of the
Manor House.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
MELVILLE LEADS TRUMPS.
</h3>

<p>
Melville possessed in an eminent degree the
gift of winning the affection of his inferiors.
Where no conflict of interest was possible
he gave full play to the sympathetic part of
his nature, which was his as it is the nature
of all musicians.  It was part of his policy,
too, to stand well in the favour of those upon
whom his comfort depended, and thus,
although he was indifferent to the appeals of
those who were inconvenienced by his
indebtedness to them, and would resort to any
subterfuge rather than pay his tradesmen's
bills, yet he was a lenient and considerate
master to his valet in Jermyn Street, was
regarded with admiration by the hall porters
of his club, and was held in affection by the
old retainers at the Manor House, who had
known him for so many years.
</p>

<p>
With Martin Somers, Sir Geoffrey's butler,
Melville was an especial favourite.  The old
man had taught him all he knew of outdoor
sports, and had often stood his friend when
in earlier days the boy was in disgrace with
his uncle.
</p>

<p>
Melville turned from the hall into the
dining-room and rang the bell.  It was cool
and shady in this room, and Melville was
conscious of a pang of regret at the knowledge
that the place would never be his.  His
life had been full of variety and excitement,
but it had cost him all chance of ever being
master of the Manor House.  Already he
was an unwelcome visitor, and when in
course of time it passed into Ralph's possession,
its doors would very probably be closed
to him altogether.
</p>

<p>
"Ralph is a stupid clown," he muttered,
"but I'm not sure that he hasn't done better
for himself than I have.  To own this place
and be Gwen's husband should be good
enough for anyone."
</p>

<p>
The sigh that escaped him was born of
sincerity, but he turned briskly to face his
immediate task as the butler came in answer
to the ring.  Melville shook hands with him,
making no reference to his previous evening
visit to his uncle.
</p>

<p>
"Here I am again, Martin," he said
cheerfully, "'Pon my word, it's good to
see you."
</p>

<p>
"You've been abroad, Master Melville?"
Martin asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Melville; "same old racket,
same old place, same old luck."
</p>

<p>
Martin shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I've no faith in Monte Carlo," he
remarked austerely; "never heard of any
good coming from there."
</p>

<p>
"That's rude," said Melville, "seeing that
I've just come from there.  How is Sir
Geoffrey?"
</p>

<p>
"Pretty well, sir," the butler replied; "I
may say very well."
</p>

<p>
"He's a wonderful old chap," said Melville.
"He'll be marrying soon and having
a family of his own; see if he doesn't."
</p>

<p>
"Sir Geoffrey never took any account of
the ladies," Martin remarked.  "It's a pity,
in some ways; but, bless you, sir, he's got
all the family a man needs in Master Ralph
and yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Too much, perhaps," said Melville.  "Go
and tell him I'm here, Martin, will you."
</p>

<p>
The old servant went, and Melville turned
to the sideboard with the air of a man who
is quite at home and helped himself to sherry
and seltzer.  Martin seemed very slow in
coming, and Melville paced up and down the
room.  As he did so he felt in his hip pocket
the little revolver which he always carried.
</p>

<p>
"Gad!" he thought, "on what a hair one's
fortune hangs!  I was within an ace of
turning that on myself when I saw Ralph's
letter, and if I had not got that cheque so
easily from Uncle Geoffrey I was mad enough
then to have turned it on to him.  And if I
had done so all this knowledge and the power
it gives would have come too late&mdash;just a
few hours too late.  And yet there are people
who don't believe in luck!"
</p>

<p>
The butler's voice interrupted his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"I'm very sorry, Master Melville, but Sir
Geoffrey cannot see you this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
Melville frowned; he saw the perplexity on
the old man's face, detected the hesitation
with which he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Cannot or will not?" he asked sharply.
</p>

<p>
Martin was no dissembler where his affections
were involved.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Geoffrey seems very put out," he
said apologetically, "and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Go back to Sir Geoffrey and say that I
must see him," said Melville peremptorily,
and reluctantly Martin obeyed.
</p>

<p>
This time he did not return.  Melville
heard the library door bang and quick steps
cross the hall.  In another moment the
dining-room door was flung open and, purple
with rage, Sir Geoffrey himself strode in.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p83"></a>
"What do you mean by forcing yourself
upon me?" he said passionately.  "Are
you so dead to all sense of decency that you
not only can't stop away after your last vile
swindle, but even have the audacity to
dictate to me in my own house?  I will not
receive you here.  Go out and stop out, or
I'll have you put out!"
</p>

<p>
Melville stood perfectly quiet.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to cause you any more annoyance,"
he said, "but my business is urgent."
</p>

<p>
"I will not hear it," shouted Sir Geoffrey.
</p>

<p>
"You must," said Melville firmly.  "I
haven't come here to-day on my own account.
I have come on behalf of Lady Holt."
</p>

<p>
For a moment the name seemed to convey
nothing to Sir Geoffrey; indeed, the
combination of words had never formed itself
before his mind; he had not inherited the
title when that passage in his life was closed.
Melville saw that he was puzzled, and with
cold emphasis he varied his announcement.
</p>

<p>
"On behalf of Lady Holt.  I have come
to see you about your wife."
</p>

<p>
Then he knew his shot had gone home.
Sir Geoffrey paled, and seemed to be on the
verge of a collapse; he turned vaguely to
the fireplace where his great armchair stood,
and sank feebly into it.
</p>

<p>
"Lady Holt!" he muttered.  "Good God! my wife!"
</p>

<p>
Melville broke the silence.
</p>

<p>
"You thought that she was dead?" he
said gently.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Sir Geoffrey; "I thought that
she was dead."  His voice was hoarse, his
face white and hopeless.  He did not question
the truth of her reappearance in his life, or
of Melville's coming as her ambassador; he
knew how cruel destiny can be, how
remorselessly she chooses our happiest moments
to deal her hardest blows.  For a moment
the shock had numbed him, but as his full
consciousness returned he was angry with
himself for having betrayed by even so much
as the quiver of an eyelid the fact that he
was hurt, albeit the hurt was mortal.
</p>

<p>
With an effort he recovered himself, and
his old sternness of manner towards Melville
returned.
</p>

<p>
"When did you make Lady Holt's acquaintance?"
he enquired coldly.  "And how
long have you known of&mdash;this?"
</p>

<p>
"I made her acquaintance yesterday,"
Melville answered; "I first heard of her
existence the day before."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said Sir Geoffrey.
</p>

<p>
Melville interpreted the exclamation
correctly; his uncle was thinking of his evening
visit for getting money.  He hastened to put
him right.
</p>

<p>
"When I got back to my chambers after
leaving you the night before last, I found a
letter from Lady Holt asking me to call upon
her yesterday, and, of course, I went."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," echoed Sir Geoffrey drily.
He could imagine the alacrity with which
Melville would follow up this discovery.
"And she has sent me a message by you?"
</p>

<p>
"No," Melville replied.  "I have come of
my own motion.  Uncle Geoffrey, your wife
is in an absolutely destitute condition&mdash;she
is starving."
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey bit his lips.  This thing was
possible, and yet he could not place reliance
on one single word his nephew uttered.  He
looked at him searchingly as if to read his
soul, but Melville never blenched, and Sir
Geoffrey was compelled to believe that in
this instance his story was true, inasmuch as
its truth was all to Melville's advantage.  If
only he could have looked his nephew in the
face and denied the whole matter!  But that
was impossible.  Not all the years that had
elapsed could undo the marriage contracted
in a moment of infatuation; all the injury
which had been heaped upon him by his
heartless wife could not release him from the
obligation he had incurred.  And now the
forgotten story had been discovered by this
unscrupulous, self-seeking schemer, who would
be only too glad to retail it to an astonished
world, unless it were made worth his while
to hold his tongue.  The suspicion leaped into
life in the old man's mind.  Melville might
be sincere in his desire to be of service to
his new-found relative, but the main plank
in his platform was blackmail; he meant to
have hush-money, and if that were not
forthcoming he would publish all the facts,
embellished, no doubt, by a malicious imagination.
</p>

<p>
At last he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I need scarcely say I believed her to be
dead.  All my efforts to find her were in
vain; but it is unnecessary to go into all that.
Give me her address and she shall receive
immediate and liberal assistance.  I will go
to her at once."
</p>

<p>
Melville shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"She will not see you.  She guessed what
you would say, and I gave her my word of
honour not to tell you where she is."
</p>

<p>
"Is that so very binding?" Sir Geoffrey
asked with scorn.  "If I am not to know
where Lady Holt lives, why should I come
to her help?"
</p>

<p>
"It is for you to decide whether you will
or not," Melville replied, "but somebody
must, and soon."
</p>

<p>
"I will help her at once if I do it myself,"
Sir Geoffrey said, "but I do not intend to
allow you to be my purse-bearer.  Do you
suppose I can place any confidence in you
after your last disgraceful performance?  How
am I even to know that you are speaking the
truth now?"
</p>

<p>
"It is entirely your own affair," said
Melville quietly.  "The case is urgent.  If
you will not assist your wife in her extremity,
I must find someone who will."
</p>

<p>
He rose to go, and Sir Geoffrey watched
him narrowly.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do?"
</p>

<p>
"One woman may befriend another,"
Melville answered; "perhaps Mrs. Austen
will be willing to help Lady Holt."
</p>

<p>
"What business is it of Mrs. Austen's
in particular?"
</p>

<p>
"I presume she is aware of Lady Holt's
existence," Melville replied, "and may
consequently be less astounded at the facts than
other of your friends might be."
</p>

<p>
He thoroughly enjoyed the situation; it
was certain that Sir Geoffrey would not allow
the story which he had kept secret so long
to be published now, at any rate, not until
he had time for further consideration of its
effect upon all concerned.  He noted the
nervous way in which his uncle clasped and
unclasped his hands upon the arms of his
chair, sure sign of the uncertainty within him,
in spite of the rigid determination of his face.
Sir Geoffrey was too proud to ask him to
keep his knowledge to himself, but that he
meant him to do so Melville was assured.
</p>

<p>
"Why did Lady Holt write to you?" Sir
Geoffrey asked suddenly; "and what has
she told you of her story?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know why she wrote to me,"
Melville answered.  "She merely said in her
note that she wished to see me, said she
married you many years ago, and asked me
to regard her letter as confidential for the
present.  I saw her yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" said Sir Geoffrey.
</p>

<p>
"She said all I need know was that she
really was your wife, and I confess she
satisfied me that she was speaking the truth.
I suppose she was?  She is Lady Holt?"
</p>

<p>
"I did marry many years ago, if you mean
that," Sir Geoffrey replied, "but whether
my wife is alive, and, if so, whether the lady
you saw is my wife, I am not in a position
to say.  Obviously, I must see her before I
do anything for her."
</p>

<p>
He thought he had scored a point, but he
was wrong.  Melville would not budge from
his original position, and so long as Sir
Geoffrey desired his old secret to remain
sacred, Melville held the key of the situation.
"I intend to keep my promise to her," he
said coldly.  "She is ill and actually destitute;
she did not write to me until things had
become so critical that she was on the point
of being turned out of her lodgings.  Of
course, I put that all right, but you will
have to see about her future."
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey winced under the whole speech;
the tone and the manner and the injustice of
it were all so cruel.
</p>

<p>
"Be straightforward for once, Melville,"
he said peremptorily, "and tell me what you
expect to get out of this?  You discover
something in my life which, for reasons of
my own, I have kept to myself.  Are you
acting in good faith on behalf of this poor
lady, or do you hope to turn your
knowledge to your own advantage?"
</p>

<p>
"You doubtless had excellent reasons for
dropping the curtain on that scene in your
life," Melville said.
</p>

<p>
"And you propose to raise it unless I
make it worth your while not to," said Sir
Geoffrey bitterly.  "I quite understand.  You
propose to add blackmailing to your other
accomplishments."
</p>

<p>
Melville declined to grow angry.
</p>

<p>
"I have merely come to tell you your wife
is starving," he observed, "and to suggest
that you should help her.  It is a condition
that your assistance should reach her through
me, for Lady Holt appears to hold her
marriage in as much detestation as you do.
The only thing I want to know now is whether
you accept the condition and will allow me to
be your envoy.  If not, I shall act as I
think proper.  That is all.  It is really very
simple."
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey got up languidly.
</p>

<p>
"I can do nothing to-day," he said, and
Melville knew he had won.  "I must write
some letters, and if you will come here
tomorrow I will give you some money for
Lady Holt's immediate needs, and consider
what steps to take for her future."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I shall not be inconveniencing
you if I stay the night here?" Melville said
with admirably assumed indifference.  "It
will be pleasant to have a pull on the river,
and will save me the double journey.  I
daresay Ralph can find me anything I may
require."
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey looked at him.  His worthy
nephew was losing no time in presenting a
draft on account, but he affected to miss
the point.
</p>

<p>
"As you please," he replied wearily;
"and now I will ask you to excuse me.  I
must be alone."
</p>

<p>
The change from the angry, outraged
uncle and guardian to the old-fashioned,
courteous gentleman was pathetic, but the
pathos was lost upon Melville.  As soon as
Sir Geoffrey left the room he rang the bell
again.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to spend the night here,
Martin," he said to the butler; "will you
find me what's necessary.  I've brought nothing down."
</p>

<p>
The old man was pleased; evidently
Master Melville had made his peace once
more.
</p>

<p>
"I'm very glad to hear it, sir," he said
deliberately.  "Mrs. and Miss Austen are
dining here to-night at eight o'clock.  I
will have everything ready for you in your
own room by seven.  Will you have some
tea now?"
</p>

<p>
"No, thanks; I'll join my brother on the
houseboat," Melville answered, and lighting
a cigarette he strolled slowly down the
garden.  "My virtuous brother will be
disconcerted," he said to himself, "and that is
always agreeable to the onlooker.  Thank
heaven, I have a sense of humour!  It is a
quality in which the very good are woefully
deficient, and Ralph is very good."

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
RIVALS.
</h3>

<p>
Ralph was disconcerted and not a little
puzzled, but neither Melville nor Sir Geoffrey
vouchsafed any explanation, and there was
a traditional discipline maintained by the
uncle over his nephews that precluded Ralph
from asking any questions.  So Melville made
himself entirely at home, and no reference
was made to the hundred pounds, for
procuring which he had been within an ace of
being prosecuted.  Moreover, the one night's
stay at the Manor House was extended into
a week, and when at length he took his
departure to London it was of his own free
motion and not at the instigation of any of
his relatives.
</p>

<p>
During the week he had several private
interviews with Sir Geoffrey, but what passed
between them was known only to
themselves.  On one occasion Mr. Tracy came
down and was closeted for some time with
Sir Geoffrey, but Melville, who was
summoned to the library, emerged ultimately
with a cheerful demeanour that effectually
disposed of any suggestion that the advent
of the solicitor was connected with his recent
fraudulent transaction.  He was, indeed,
remarkably well pleased with the results of
that particular debate, and subsequently
jingled the money in his pockets with a
light-heartedness most unseemly in a culprit.
</p>

<p>
Finally he bade a friendly farewell to his
brother, a deferential one to his uncle, and a
regretful one to Gwendolen Austen, and
with the utmost self-satisfaction journeyed
back to his chambers in Jermyn Street to
enjoy the remainder of the season on an
unruffled conscience and a well-filled purse.
</p>

<p>
His first visit was to his starving aunt,
who gave him an excellent luncheon,
accompanied by claret of undeniable quality; the
impression left upon his mind at their first
interview, that he had found an extremely
pleasant acquaintance, was confirmed.
Mrs. Sinclair was a "good comrade," and Melville
became one of her most frequent visitors
and her usual squire to the theatre and other
places where the world amuses itself.  He
liked her unaffectedly, and she liked him,
and the little house in The Vale would have
had unalloyed charm for Melville but for
the constant presence there of two other
people.
</p>

<p>
The first of these was Mrs. Sinclair's maid,
Lucille, who had admitted him on the occasion
of his first visit.  Entirely devoted to her
mistress, with whom she had lived for many
years, she had done her utmost to dissuade
Lavender from writing to Melville and thus
introducing an element of difficulty into a
career now undisturbed, and likely to end in
a marriage so desirable as that with the
wealthy Scotch baronet, Sir Ross Buchanan.
</p>

<p>
The other was Sir Ross Buchanan himself,
who was with Mrs. Sinclair in the Casino at
Monte Carlo on the night when Melville
became the recipient of the <i>viaticum</i>.  Subject
to the limitations suggested by his native
Scotch caution, he intended to bestow his
large fortune and his small person upon
Mrs. Sinclair, and, knowing nothing of Melville's
relationship by marriage to the object of his
passion, he regarded him with dislike and
jealous mistrust.  He took no pains to
conceal his dislike of Melville, and told
Mrs. Sinclair in so many words that he disapproved
of his visits.
</p>

<p>
"Have you any more grown-up relations
to spring upon me?" he asked sarcastically.
</p>

<p>
"Now you're being stupid," she replied.
"He is related to me and I like him, and
now that I've opened my doors to him, I'm
not going to close them again to gratify your
caprice."
</p>

<p>
Sir Ross frowned.
</p>

<p>
"I hate the brute," he said viciously,
"and I object to his visiting you."
</p>

<p>
"Then I had better arrange that you
should not meet him," Mrs. Sinclair answered;
"there will be no difficulty about that."
</p>

<p>
"I object to his visiting you at all," Sir
Ross repeated.  "You are too fond of him
as it is; your attentions are quite marked.
If you are so much attached to him now,
there is no reason why you should not insist
upon receiving him after we are married,
and that I have no intention of permitting."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sinclair was not the woman to brook
dictation.
</p>

<p>
"You might conceivably have some ground
for objecting to Mr. Ashley visiting me if he
were not related to me," she said coldly,
"though even then I should think you
unreasonable.  But he is related to me, so
your objection is merely absurd.  Whatever
you may do after we are married, you cannot
revise my visiting list now."
</p>

<p>
"How is he related to you?" Sir Ross
asked angrily, but that was a question which
Mrs. Sinclair did not choose to answer.  Sir
Ross knew all about Mr. Sinclair, with whom
Lavender really believed her marriage to
have been perfectly legal, but he did not
know anything about Sir Geoffrey Holt, and
Lavender was particularly anxious that he
should not.  The only command she had
laid upon Melville was that he should not
talk about his uncle, and he had faithfully
obeyed her.  As potential husbands are not
in the habit of discussing their predecessors
in that office, she knew that Sir Ross would
not talk about Mr. Sinclair, so that there had
been no difficulty on that score either.  Thus
Melville was in ignorance of the fact that
there ever had been any Mr. Sinclair, and
Sir Ross was in ignorance, if not of Sir Geoffrey
Holt's existence, at any rate of the part he
had played in Lavender Sinclair's life.  But
for the impulse which had prompted her to
claim Melville as her nephew, all the facts
might have remained in the oblivion into
which they had sunk.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Sir Ross, as Lavender
remained silent, "if I cannot yet revise your
visiting list, I can put you to your election
between this person and myself.  I have the
honour to be your accepted suitor, and I
object to this gentleman's attentions.  You
will be so good as to choose between him
and me.  If in defiance of my wishes you
continue to receive him I shall absent myself
from your house and consider our engagement
at an end.  If you are unwilling that that
should occur you will dismiss Mr. Ashley as
summarily as you took him up.  I require
you to choose between him and me, and I
will come to-morrow for your answer.  Good
afternoon!" and unceremoniously hurrying
into the hall he crammed his hat upon his
head and marched away in high dudgeon.
</p>

<p>
But fortune still favoured Melville, or else
it was Destiny leading him by easy gradations
down to his destruction.  For when the
morrow came, bright and sunny, he found
that he had no engagements until the evening,
and determined to while away part of the
time by chatting with his aunt.  He therefore
sauntered leisurely towards South Kensington,
pausing in Piccadilly to buy some hothouse
flowers for her.  When he reached The Vale,
Mrs. Sinclair was engaged with a dressmaker,
and Melville, leaving the flowers in the hall,
was shown into the drawing-room to wait
her pleasure.  Lucille brought the message
asking him to wait, and was on the point of
returning upstairs when the bell rang again.
She opened the door and saw Sir Ross
Buchanan, to whose cause with her mistress
she was a staunch adherent.  Instead of
going upstairs to enquire whether Mrs. Sinclair
was at home to him, Lucille took it upon
herself to ask him, too, to wait, and ushered
him into the drawing-room where Melville
already was.
</p>

<p>
"There isn't any love lost between those
two gentlemen," she thought as she opened
the drawing-room door and noticed the
change in Sir Ross's expression when his eye
fell upon Melville, "and I'll give them the
opportunity of having a few words.  If Sir
Ross is the man I take him for, he'll make it
clear to Mr. Ashley that his room is preferred
to his company."
</p>

<p>
Melville greeted Sir Ross cheerfully, ignoring
the scowl upon the little baronet's face.
</p>

<p>
"Nice and cool in here," he remarked.
"Mrs. Sinclair is engaged&mdash;frocks and frills,
I understand, and all that sort of thing."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't have the impertinence to ask
particulars," snapped Sir Ross, "and I don't
take any interest in the details of ladies'
toilettes."
</p>

<p>
"No?" said Melville.  "That's a mistake;
you should always be interested in what
interests women, and nothing interests them
so much as frocks&mdash;except frills."
</p>

<p>
"I don't require any lessons in how to
deal with women, thanks," said Sir Ross.
</p>

<p>
Melville was amused.  A little conversational
fencing was always to his taste, and
when one's opponent is angry to begin with,
the odds are on oneself.
</p>

<p>
"Shouldn't presume to offer any to a man
of the world, such as you are," he said, but
if it was his intention to mollify Sir Ross,
he was disappointed.
</p>

<p>
"I have an appointment with Mrs. Sinclair
to-day," the baronet said, "on a matter of
some importance.  Perhaps you could make
it convenient not to wait to see her this
afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Sinclair asked me to wait," Melville
replied; "so I will, thanks."  That
Buchanan wanted him to go was enough to
induce him to remain, but it was the only
reason.  Sir Ross, however, could not be
expected to know that.
</p>

<p>
"To be precise, I have come to see her
about you," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! believe me, I am of no importance,"
Melville answered, smiling, "no importance
whatever."
</p>

<p>
Sir Ross fumed and considered.  Since
Melville was obviously determined not to
budge, perhaps the best thing to do was to
explain the terms on which he stood with
Mrs. Sinclair, and tell him quite frankly that
he did not mean to put up with any tame
cats.  Incidentally, too, he might find out
what the alleged relationship between
Mrs. Sinclair and Melville amounted to.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you are not aware of the footing
on which I stand with regard to Mrs. Sinclair?"
he said, in a somewhat challenging tone.
</p>

<p>
"That of a valued friend, I am sure,"
Melville replied, a grin belying the politeness
of his words.
</p>

<p>
"I am her affianced husband," Sir Ross
announced pompously.
</p>

<p>
"The deuce you are!" said Melville.  "I
beg your pardon, I'm sure," he added hastily,
"but you rather took me by surprise.  Pray
accept my warm congratulations."
</p>

<p>
"The fact that I am engaged to be married
to her," Sir Ross went on, taking no notice
of the congratulations, "will perhaps serve
as an excuse for what I am going to say.
You come here too much, Mr. Ashley, and I
don't like it&mdash;I don't like it.  Your constant
attendance excites remark, and may compromise
Mrs. Sinclair.  That, in the circumstances,
is a thing which I cannot permit."
</p>

<p>
He drew himself up and endeavoured to
assume an air of commanding dignity.  Melville,
on the track of a mystery, never made
a mistake.  How Mrs. Sinclair contemplated
marrying Sir Ross Buchanan, or anybody
else, until Sir Geoffrey Holt shuffled off this
mortal coil he could not conceive, but Sir
Ross was evidently quite in earnest, and by
fooling him to the top of his bent he might
induce him to impart knowledge, which
Melville had ever found a most valuable
asset.
</p>

<p>
"I quite understand, Sir Ross," he
murmured.  "It is a most natural and proper
feeling.  But believe me, if I have been
indiscreet I have erred through ignorance."
</p>

<p>
"You have been indiscreet," Sir Ross
retorted, "and I am resolved that the
indiscretion shall be terminated.  I discussed
the matter with Mrs. Sinclair yesterday, and,
in point of fact, my appointment with her
to-day was made that I might receive her
answer."
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me if I'm dense," Melville said,
"but even now I don't quite understand.
That you might receive her answer to what?"
</p>

<p>
"You compel me to be candid," Sir Ross
said, getting very red; "in plain English, I
told Mrs. Sinclair that one of us&mdash;either you
or I&mdash;must discontinue calling at her house,
and I've come to know which it is to be."
</p>

<p>
Melville hugged himself.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Sir Ross," he protested, "you
do me too much honour.  I could never
aspire to be your rival in any case.  In this
case the honour of your jealousy is so
unnecessary.  My relationship to Mrs. Sinclair
puts any idea of a more intimate tie out of
the question."
</p>

<p>
"What is your relationship to her?" Sir
Ross asked bluntly.
</p>

<p>
Melville was on his guard at once.  Acquiring
information was one thing, imparting it
another.  If Sir Ross did not know,
Mrs. Sinclair must have had her reasons for not
telling him, and Melville was no marplot;
he preferred to stand in.
</p>

<p>
"I am related to her by marriage," he
answered vaguely.
</p>

<p>
"I knew the late Mr. Sinclair intimately,"
Sir Ross replied, "and I never heard of any
relations of his named Ashley.  However, it
doesn't affect my point."
</p>

<p>
"I've a shocking memory for dates,"
Melville said.  "How long is it actually
since Mr. Sinclair died?"
</p>

<p>
"He died on Jubilee Day," Sir Ross
answered shortly.  "Mr. Ashley, I've been
quite frank with you, and you will oblige
me by giving me a specific answer to my
question.  Do you, now you know the facts,
intend to observe my request that you will
discontinue your very marked attentions to
the lady who has done me the honour to
accept my hand?"
</p>

<p>
"I think I must ask you to await Mrs. Sinclair's
answer, for which you have called
by appointment," Melville answered suavely.
"You see, Sir Ross, this is her house, and I
can only accept dismissal from it at the
desire of its owner, who invited me to it.
There is another point, too; my relationship
to Mrs. Sinclair renders your apprehensions
unnecessary, and I think it would be
presumption on my part to do anything to
suggest they were well founded."
</p>

<p>
"In short, you won't go?" Sir Ross asked,
with suppressed fury.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, no," Melville replied.
</p>

<p>
"Then I will," said Sir Ross, and rising
abruptly he bounced out of the door, leaving
Melville in possession of the field.
</p>

<p>
Lavender Sinclair, coming downstairs at
that moment, met him in the hall.
</p>

<p>
"You're not going, are you?" she enquired.
"I am sorry I've been so long."
</p>

<p>
"I was going," he answered, "but perhaps
it may not be necessary.  I've come for
your answer, Lavender.  Which is it to be?"
</p>

<p>
"Come into the dining-room," she said,
"and have a cigarette.  What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Which is it to be?" he repeated.  "I
put you to your choice yesterday.  Do you
choose to dismiss Mr. Ashley or me?"
</p>

<p>
"How silly you are!" she said
good-humouredly.  "Fancy your still harping on
that string!  You needn't meet Mr. Ashley,
need you?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't help it," Sir Ross retorted; "the
brute's always here.  I've been shut up
with him now for the last half-hour."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sinclair laughed, though in reality
she was a little annoyed.
</p>

<p>
"How foolish of Lucille to put you into
the same room!  But it shall not occur
again.  It was the merest accident."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know about an accident," Sir
Ross growled; "it was a misfortune.
Lavender, I meant what I said yesterday; you
must choose between this man and me.  Are
you going to send him about his business?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Mrs. Sinclair obstinately; "I
am not.  What is it you object to in him?"
</p>

<p>
"I object to everything," Sir Ross
answered.  "I don't like you having any man
hanging about you so much, and I bar this
particular one.  That ought to be enough."
</p>

<p>
"I believe you're jealous," Mrs. Sinclair
said.
</p>

<p>
"It don't matter what I am," Sir Ross
said angrily, "if you're not going to take
any notice of my wishes.  Jealous or not,
I'm in earnest.  Which is it to be?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't affront people in this way," she
replied.  "What reason am I to give him?"
</p>

<p>
"I've done that for you," Sir Ross
remarked.  "I told him you were going to
marry me, and that I wouldn't have him
compromising you."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sinclair was irritated.
</p>

<p>
"You had no right to do anything of the
kind," she said warmly.  "What did he
say?"
</p>

<p>
"He said he would go if, and when, you
told him," Sir Ross answered.  "Will you
tell him now?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Mrs. Sinclair; "certainly not."
</p>

<p>
"Then I will wish you a very good-day,"
he answered frigidly.  "Pray do not trouble
to come into the hall.  You are keeping Mr. Ashley waiting."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," she replied with unconcern.
"Come back when you're in a better temper.
Won't you take your flowers?"
</p>

<p>
She held out Melville's offering, and it
proved the last straw.  Sir Ross controlled
himself by a heroic effort, but vouchsafed no
answer to this feminine last word.  He
departed in a frame of mind that was positively dangerous.
</p>

<p>
"He'll come back," Mrs. Sinclair said
cheerfully to Lucille, who had been a witness
of the baronet's exit, but the maid shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"I don't fancy he will," she said.  She
was sorry, for Sir Ross's title appealed to her
imagination, and she had anticipated with
satisfaction her mistress's promotion in the
social scale.  "I've never seen Sir Ross so
put out before, and I don't fancy he will
come back."
</p>

<p>
"Then he can stay away," Mrs. Sinclair
replied; "but it's as well to begin as you
mean to go on, and if he is so eccentric before
marriage I don't suppose he'd be any better
afterwards.  Fancy his objecting to
Mr. Ashley coming here!"
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't think much of him if he
didn't object," Lucille answered primly.
"Any man who is a man dislikes another
man paying attention to his young lady.
Mr. Ashley brought those flowers, ma'am."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sinclair laughed; the philosophy of
the remark amused her, and her mistake
about the bouquet struck her as really funny.
She looked at herself in the mirror, and put
back a curl of hair that had strayed out of
place.  Then she picked up the flowers.
</p>

<p>
"How sweet of Mr. Ashley to think of
them," she said.  "I must go and thank
him at once," and, still bubbling over with
amusement, she went into the drawing-room.
But, outside, Lucille still shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"It's a mistake," she said to herself, "and
she'll live to regret it, I'm sure."

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
BIGAMY.
</h3>

<p>
From the drawing-room window Melville
watched Sir Ross prancing down the garden
path, and then he turned to Mrs. Sinclair as
she came in holding his flowers.  He would
have assumed a penitent demeanour if the
situation had seemed to require it, but a
glance at his aunt's face reassured him.  The
laughter in her eyes was infectious, and
Melville laughed in response.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Ross looks a little put out," he said
tentatively.
</p>

<p>
"He's in an abominable temper," Mrs. Sinclair
answered.  "You have a great deal
to answer for, Melville.  You are the cause
of quite a serious quarrel between that
excellent little man and myself."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry if you're sorry," Melville said.
"He doesn't like me, I know, but I wonder
why?"
</p>

<p>
"Is it so surprising?" she enquired.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Melville candidly, "most
people do like me, you know&mdash;barring the
very good ones."
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Mrs. Sinclair.  "The fact is
Sir Ross thinks you are too attentive to me."
</p>

<p>
"So he told me," Melville answered.  "He
left me in no doubt as to what he wanted;
he regards me as a sort of trespasser, and
desired me to clear out and not come back."
</p>

<p>
"What did you say?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I suggested that perhaps it was
rather your affair than his, and then he said
that one of us had got to go, and we played
a sort of nursery game&mdash;'twasn't me and
'twas you, don't you know&mdash;I didn't go, so
he did.  Am I really compromising you&mdash;aunt?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course you're not," she said laughing.
"There's a perfect explanation of your coming
here in our relationship, but I don't choose
to produce the family pedigree on demand.
In plain English, Sir Ross is jealous of you,
and jealous people are capable of anything."
</p>

<p>
"So it appears," Melville said.  "From
the way Sir Ross waltzed down to the gate
I thought the gravel must be red-hot.  Only
a very angry man could prance as he did.
By the way, he asked me how I was related
to you."
</p>

<p>
"Did you tell him?" she asked a little
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Not I," said Melville.  "I saw he didn't
know, and inferred you hadn't told him, so I
explained that we were related by marriage,
and eased him off a point or two."
</p>

<p>
"That was quite right," Mrs. Sinclair said
approvingly.  "You should never gratify idle
curiosity."
</p>

<p>
Melville assented, but decided mentally
that his own desire for information was
different from the idle curiosity of Sir Ross
Buchanan, and resolved that it should be
satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"It was unfortunate," Mrs. Sinclair went
on, "that Lucille should have shown you
both into the same room, but it must have
been very funny to see you glaring at each
other."
</p>

<p>
Melville expostulated.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't glare.  I purred&mdash;positively
purred, but it was no good.  Sir Ross meant
to lose his temper and he lost it.  He doesn't
believe in our relationship a little bit.  He
said he knew the late Mr. Sinclair intimately,
and never heard of any relations of his named
Ashley."
</p>

<p>
"That's quite true," Mrs. Sinclair said
simply; "he did know him, but he doesn't
know that I was married to Sir Geoffrey
Holt."
</p>

<p>
Melville looked at her sharply.  He could
tell from her voice and from the way she
spoke that she had no idea of the sequence
of thoughts passing in his mind.  Once
more fortune was smiling on him.  Sir Ross
Buchanan's casual remark had opened his
eyes to a possible fact.  Mrs. Sinclair herself
could corroborate it, and once more knowledge
would give him power.  His marvellous
faculty of reading faces stood him in good
stead.  Criminal or fool, whichever she might
be, this woman did not suspect him now of
cross-examining her from any sinister motive.
She assumed that he knew something which
he did not know, but which, if he were
careful, she would let him know.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Sinclair died on Jubilee Day, didn't
he?" he said, and Mrs. Sinclair nodded.
For once in his life Melville was really puzzled,
and puzzled because in his cool, calculating
way of doing wrong he made no allowance
for possible ignorance of the wrong.  But it
was evident that the woman in front of him
scented no danger, and he played a bold game.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me, Lavender, for putting things
so bluntly, but tell me&mdash;was there really any
Mr. Sinclair at all?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course there was," she answered,
quite surprised.
</p>

<p>
"When did you marry him?"
</p>

<p>
"Five years before; that is, in ninety-two."
</p>

<p>
"But Sir Geoffrey Holt is living."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mrs. Sinclair.
</p>

<p>
"And you were legally married to him,
weren't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Most certainly I was," she said indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear lady," Melville said,
raising his brows so that the eye-glass dropped
from his eye into his hand outstretched to
catch it, "I don't care as a rule for calling a
spade a spade, but it's the simple fact that
you have committed bigamy."
</p>

<p>
If Melville expected his hostess to recoil
with the dismay not unnatural in a criminal
suddenly unmasked, he was disappointed.
For a moment Mrs. Sinclair looked at him
in blank astonishment, colouring slightly, it is
true, but from indignation, not from shame,
and when she spoke again it was with the
same obvious ignorance of guilt that she
had made the statement which so much
surprised Melville.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be preposterous," she remarked
at length.  "Bigamy?  Absurd!"
</p>

<p>
"It's anything but absurd," Melville
retorted.  "It's an uncommonly serious
matter."
</p>

<p>
"But I had left Sir Geoffrey ages before,"
Mrs. Sinclair argued, "and hadn't heard of
him or from him for years and years.  I
didn't even know he was alive."
</p>

<p>
"Did you try to find out?" Melville
asked curtly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mrs. Sinclair; "but I didn't
succeed, and I never connected my husband
with the baronet in possession of Fairbridge.
Anyhow, I had heard nothing of him for
ages, and everybody knows that if you lose
sight of your husband or your wife for seven
years, you can marry again."
</p>

<p>
Melville considered.  Evidently Mrs. Sinclair
was an ignorant sort of woman, and,
as a rule, it is only ignorant people who can
be influenced by fear.  At any rate, he
could try to frighten her into telling him
the facts, and it would be his own fault only
if he could not turn them to his own advantage.
His part as accessory after the fact
could be explained easily enough if the
occasion should ever arise.
</p>

<p>
"I know there are people who labour
under that delusion," he said, "but it is a
delusion.  Marriage once contracted is binding
until it is dissolved by death or decree,
and while Sir Geoffrey could, doubtless, get a
decree now in the Divorce Court, it could only
be after your conviction at the Old Bailey."
</p>

<p>
He spoke icily and deliberately, and his
words had the desired effect.  Mrs. Sinclair's
eyes dilated, and, although she retained her
self-command, her bosom rose and fell quickly,
betraying the emotion within her, and the
emotion was fear.  Melville was satisfied.
He turned to her with a pleasant, sympathetic
smile which might have inspired confidence
in the heart of the most suspicious.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me all about it, Lavender," he said
gently.  "Naked truth is always a little bit
shocking.  I suppose that is why you only
get it in savage countries.  But it is the
naked truth that you have committed bigamy,
and it looks to me uncommonly as if you
contemplated doing it again.  Tell me all
about it.  I don't suppose you have one
disinterested adviser among all the people
you know, and this is certainly a case where
two heads are better than one.  I won't give
you away.  What are the facts?"
</p>

<p>
His frankness completely took her in, as
completely as his definition of her offence had
satisfied her.  She sat down in a chair,
nervously beating a tattoo upon its arms
with her plump fingers, and every now and
then stealing a glance at Melville from
underneath her lashes.
</p>

<p>
"I can't believe you are right," she said,
"but perhaps I may as well tell you what
did happen.  I know I can trust you if&mdash;if
I was wrong."
</p>

<p>
"Implicitly," Melville murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she said hesitatingly, punctuating
her story with little pauses as if in doubt
how much detail to fill in.  "I was very
young and&mdash;and pretty, and desperately
poor when I met your uncle, and he
was&mdash;rather old, and well-to-do and very kind.
And I married him.  I thought everything
would be comfortable, don't you know.
But I couldn't stand it.  He wanted to
have me educated, and I wanted to go about
and see life.  It was like trying to boil a
tea-kettle over a volcano.  We had most
frightful quarrels, and very soon I made up my
mind to leave him.  And one day I just walked
out of the house and never went back."
</p>

<p>
The way she summarised what must have
been a tragedy was pathetic, and Melville
was able to imagine what that home must
have been like when it was the theatre of
such a conflict between passionate youth and
determined middle age.
</p>

<p>
"Where did you go to?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"A girl I knew had lately married, and I
went to her.  Her husband was manager of
an old-fashioned hotel on the South Coast,
and they gave me a home.  I was useful to
them, so there was no obligation on either
side.  I stayed there a long time, and it
was there that I met Mr. Sinclair."
</p>

<p>
"Did you never hear of Sir Geoffrey?"
</p>

<p>
"Never.  After I marched out of his
house that morning I was frightened, and at
least two years went by before I dared to
ask anything about him.  He had left the
house we lived in and disappeared too.  He
may have tried to trace me, but a child is
very easily lost, and I was only a child.
Anyhow, he never found me.  And when a
long time afterwards Mr. Sinclair asked me
to marry him, I thought that I was free, and
finally I consented.  I knew I had no claim upon
Sir Geoffrey, and I honestly believed he had
none on me.  Are you sure I was not free?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite sure," Melville answered.  "Tell
me the rest."
</p>

<p>
"We were married, and got along all
right, and he died," she replied.  "It was
just like hundreds of other marriages, I
suppose.  I don't know that I loved him
particularly, but I was a pretty good wife,
and he left me comfortably provided for,
and&mdash;and that is the end of the story."
</p>

<p>
She gave vent to a defiant little laugh,
and looked at Melville.
</p>

<p>
"Those are the facts," she said.  "Now,
if you are right and I was wrong, tell me
the position."
</p>

<p>
"Honestly, it's a very unpleasant one,"
Melville answered.  "You see, Sir Geoffrey
being alive at the time, your marriage with
Mr. Sinclair was quite invalid.  Sir Geoffrey
could divorce you on the facts and you would
have no claim on him for alimony; and,
on the other hand, you would forfeit all the
income you derive from Mr. Sinclair's estate
as his widow, which legally, of course, you
are not."
</p>

<p>
There was an interval, during which the
minds of both worked quickly.
</p>

<p>
"What am I to do about Sir Ross?" Mrs. Sinclair
asked presently.  "I suppose I shall
have to say that, for reasons that have just
come to my knowledge, I can't marry him,
or something of the sort.  But he is
dreadfully inquisitive; and, besides, any man
would want something more definite than
that."
</p>

<p>
"What more definite reason can you
give?" Melville enquired.
</p>

<p>
"I shall have to tell him about Sir
Geoffrey," she answered.
</p>

<p>
Melville immediately foresaw the objection
to this.  Sir Ross Buchanan would almost
certainly do his best to get to the bottom
of the whole thing; he would go to
Fairbridge, with the result that Sir Geoffrey
would learn where his wife was living and
in what comfort; the funds he had been
giving to Melville for her assistance would
be withdrawn, and Melville would thus be
thrown upon his own resources once again.
</p>

<p>
"That will not do at all," he said decisively;
"it would be most dangerous.  Sir Ross
must remain in ignorance of the whole
affair.  Why, just think!  If this reached
Sir Geoffrey's ears he would prosecute you
for bigamy at once and obtain a divorce;
you would lose the whole of your present
income, and Sir Ross would certainly never
make you his wife.  No; this must remain
a secret between you and me."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to tell him," Lavender
admitted.  "He knew Mr. Sinclair
personally, but even if Sir Geoffrey were dead
I should not care for him to know that I'd
been married twice already.  That is why
I've never explained how you are related
to me, not because I thought there was any
harm in what I'd done.  Can we really keep
it to ourselves, Melville?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," he answered.  "You've
proved that you can keep a secret, which is
more than most women can do, and you
may rely upon me.  I am as safe as the
bank."
</p>

<p>
"Sir Ross is so jealous of you," Mrs. Sinclair
said.  "He told me to-day that I
must choose between you, and went off in a
huff because I would not order you out of
the house."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay it's just as well," Melville said
indifferently; "you may be glad of a day
or two to think things over in.  There's no
blinking the fact that this is serious.  When
Sir Ross turns up again let me know, and
don't do anything without consulting me."
</p>

<p>
"I think you are right," Mrs. Sinclair
said.  "For the present I will say nothing
to him about it, and if any difficulty arises&mdash;I
mean, if he presses me to marry him at
once, or anything of that sort&mdash;I will come
to you for advice."
</p>

<p>
"We will leave it like that," Melville
assented.  "For the present things can go
on as they are.  Above all, don't get frightened
and lose your head."
</p>

<p>
"I'm very grateful to you, Melville,"
Mrs. Sinclair murmured; her words were at once
an expression of gratitude and an appeal,
for, in sober truth, she was very frightened
already.  It was as if the solid ground had
suddenly opened, and as if a bottomless pit
were yawning before her feet.
</p>

<p>
Melville took her hands in his.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," he said, smiling kindly
at her.  "Show your gratitude by playing
the game like a sportsman.  If there is any
way out of the mess I'll find it for you.
Keep a stout heart.  Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
He walked away from the house apparently
absorbed in thought, but when he was out
of sight he fairly rubbed his hands.
</p>

<p>
"It's like a bally game of chess," he said
with glee, "and the chess-board's like Tom
Tiddler's ground; there's gold and silver for
me on every bally square simply waiting to
be picked up.  Just now it's Sir Geoffrey
sending me to the assistance of the queen,
who's in a tight place: starving, if you please,
on about a thousand a year; and if for any
reason that source of revenue dries up, the
queen can be driven into the arms of Sir
Ross.  More bigamy, unless Sir Geoffrey is
translated to another sphere, and if he is it
won't matter very much to me.  If my
polygamous aunt marries Sir Ross Buchanan
at all I shall be able to draw a very respectable
percentage of her annual income.  Oh,
these knights and ladies!"
</p>

<p>
But indoors, Lavender Sinclair, with a
very white face, sat thinking, thinking,
thinking, and the only thought which was
really clear before her mind was how
fortunate it was that she had met Melville
Ashley when she did.  In him, at any rate,
she possessed one loyal friend on whom she
could rely.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
LIGHT COME, LIGHT GO.
</h3>

<p>
Lucille's forebodings were justified by the
event.  Days passed by and Sir Ross
Buchanan neither wrote nor called; but
while the maid was filled with real concern at
this interruption in a love story of which
she had been so sympathetic an eye-witness,
her mistress regarded it with indifference.
At first she even hailed it as a relief, for it
did away with all possibility of her being
called upon to give explanations for what
she saw must be the definite postponement
of her marriage with him.  She lost no time
in verifying Melville's statement about the
invalidity of her marriage with Mr. Sinclair,
and the more she considered her position
the uneasier she grew.  She was afraid to
take a legal opinion upon it, and to her fear
of losing the income she derived from a charge
upon Mr. Sinclair's estate was added terror
of the pains and penalties to which, in her
ignorance of all legal matters, she thought
her bigamous marriage had rendered her
liable.  That she had acted in good faith at
the time afforded her but little consolation.
She had done something punishable by law,
and she was in terror of anyone else finding
it out.
</p>

<p>
In Melville's discretion she had perfect
confidence; it never occurred to her that
the danger might lie upon his side.  Why
she should feel such security in the case of
the only man who had any knowledge of her
offence she would have been at a loss to
explain.  Anything like self-analysis was
quite foreign to her temperament; probably
she recognised in Melville Ashley some
fellowship of nature and of habit, none the less
real because undefinable.  And yet in spite
of this fellowship there was this vast
difference between them, that he was a bad man,
entirely unprincipled and utterly selfish,
while she was not a bad woman.  Her
terribly ill-assorted marriage as a child with
Sir Geoffrey Holt had been too great a tax
upon her uncurbed nature, and she had put
an end to it in the summary, reckless way
that any savage child would do; yet had
it been possible for that strange couple to
bear and forbear with each other, a little
time might have worked what then seemed
a miracle, and the story of their lives might
have been very different.
</p>

<p>
While, however, Lavender Sinclair regarded
Sir Ross's temporary defection with
equanimity, being indeed convinced that it was
only temporary, and that when she chose
she could whistle him back to her side, she
felt that Melville Ashley's attendance was
daily growing more necessary to her.  To
women of the type to which she belonged,
the companionship of men is indispensable.
But Melville, too, absented himself from The
Vale.  As a matter of fact, he was playing
for big stakes, and had no intention of losing
the game from any failure to give it due
consideration.
</p>

<p>
His return from Monte Carlo and the few
days of absolute impecuniosity, culminating
in his so nearly executed idea of suicide, had
marked a period in his career.  Up to that
moment he had drifted along in a happy-go-lucky
fashion, enjoying himself when in
funds, existing somehow when he was hard
up, but always contriving in an irresponsible
way to have what he called a pretty good
time.  But that night when he looked death
squarely in the face had altered him.  He
vowed that such necessity should not arise
again, and his evil genius had come to his
assistance by placing him in possession of
Sir Geoffrey Holt's old secret.  In concocting
the story of Mrs. Sinclair's destitution,
Melville had not aimed solely at getting a single
sum of money from his uncle.  He determined
to secure an annual subsidy to be paid to
him on her behalf, and the negotiations were
beset with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
At first Sir Geoffrey was in favour of the
straightforward, common-sensible policy of a
point-blank refusal to part with a shilling
except to Lady Holt herself.  He utterly
distrusted Melville, and scouted the idea of
appointing him his almoner.  But the old
man's pride was a factor in the problem
which the young one had not under-estimated.
He could not bring himself to face what he
regarded as a scandal, although in all essential
particulars it was only he who had been
wronged.  Thus Melville had only to
reiterate his intention of observing his promise
to Mrs. Sinclair not to betray her whereabouts,
and take precautions against being
shadowed by any emissaries from his uncle,
and he could afford to wait until Sir Geoffrey
should decide.  As a matter of fact he had
decided to submit to what was nothing less
than blackmail, and was endeavouring to
make arrangements for the payment to his
wife of an income of four hundred pounds a
year, to be given quarterly to Melville until
it could be given direct to Lady Holt, and
to take such precautions as the circumstances
allowed against the whole of the subsidy
being misappropriated by Melville for his
own purposes.
</p>

<p>
But until the matter had been completed
and put upon such a basis as to seem tolerably
secure, Melville felt that his constant
attendance upon his uncle was at least expedient.
So his visits to Fairbridge became more
frequent than they had been for several
years past, and their effect upon the two
establishments at the Manor House and The
Grange was very marked.  No hawk can
take up his quarters in a dove-cote without
causing a commotion in the farmyard, and
this was what happened now.
</p>

<p>
Ralph was moody and suspicious; he
avoided his brother as much as he could, and
recognised his existence only so much as
was inevitable if he would not be actually rude
to his uncle's guest.  Sir Geoffrey was always
studiously polite to Melville, but on most
occasions shut himself up in his library to
commune with his own thoughts, and denied
access to everyone, not excepting Gwendolen.
She, indeed, was in the most invidious position
of all, for her mother liked Melville, and
made much of him, thinking that he was
a rather misunderstood young man whose
latent merits it only required a little sympathy
and affection to evoke.  And his music was
superb.  He kept his Amati at The Grange,
and whenever opportunity offered would play
to the accompaniment of Gwendolen, herself
a musician of no mean order.  The girl was
divided between two emotions.  Her love
for Ralph would have kept her ever by his
side to the sacrifice of everything and
everybody else, but, since Melville's reappearance,
Ralph was preoccupied and taciturn, avoiding
The Grange when, as so often happened, his
brother was there.  On those many occasions
Gwendolen was obliged to remain at home,
and her devotion to her duty was always
rewarded by hearing Melville play.  His bow
was a magician's wand, drawing music from
the violin that stole into Gwendolen's heart
and held her very soul spell-bound.
</p>

<p>
"No man can be bad who plays as divinely
as he does," she often thought, and Melville,
noting the rapt expression on her face and
the moisture in her glorious eyes, would play
as he had never played before, until the silence
that followed the dying away of the last note
was broken by an involuntary sigh from
all who had the privilege of listening.
</p>

<p>
Thus it was that Melville forsook The Vale
in favour of The Grange.  But at last his
business came to a satisfactory conclusion,
and, provided with what he hoped and
believed would be the first of a series of
cheques, he returned in jubilant mood to
town.
</p>

<p>
Invitations in plenty poured upon him,
and he devoted himself to enjoyment.  But
with the possession of money returned the
old insatiable desire for excitement that had
always been his bane.  All his good resolutions
proved to be straws in the wind.  Races
and suppers and cards once more became the
order of his days and nights, and among the
set that lives&mdash;and dies&mdash;by its wits Melville
resumed his place as leader.  Like all confirmed
gamblers, his faith in his star revived,
and he could not believe that fortune would
ever desert him finally.  When things were
at their blackest the goddess had given the
kaleidoscope a turn and dazzled his eyes by
the blaze of colours in the glass before him.
</p>

<p>
Thus it was with particular pleasure that
he accepted an invitation to make one of a
party at a great race meeting, and spick and
span in new apparel, with glasses slung across
his shoulder, he joined the coach at Hatchett's,
and, sanguine as ever, mounted to his seat.
His information was exclusive, the banknotes
in his pocket book were new and crisp, and
would be multiplied tenfold when he got
back to town.  A light rain in the early
morning had laid the dust, and the roads
were in perfect condition; high overhead
thin wisps of clouds were blown swiftly across
a grey-blue sky, betokening a breeze that
would temper the heat of the summer day.
With a jest upon every lip, and a plenitude
of coppers for all the children shouting by
the roadside, the party drove away.
</p>

<p>
But when the sun was setting behind them,
and the team of bays was swinging into
London, the smile upon Melville's face, in
common with the others, was replaced by
a look of utter dejection.  The horses which,
according to his information, were to do such
wonderful things had, without exception,
failed to fulfil his expectations; in every
single race his fancy had gone down, not
even succeeding in getting into a place;
conversation was monosyllabic upon the coach;
the guard proclaimed its coming by
melancholy toots upon his horn instead of by
selections adapted from "The Washington
Post" and "The Flowers that bloom in the
Spring"; there were no pennies for the
children, no Japanese lanterns swinging from
the seats.  The whole party was sick and
sorry.  Melville finished the day, according
to the programme, with dinner at his host's
flat and a modest game of cards, yet even at
that nobody seemed to win.  And when,
after a final flutter at <i>petit-paquet</i> and a
tumbler of champagne, Melville let himself
into his own chambers in the small hours of
the morning, very little was left of the
considerable sum with which he had left
Fairbridge such a short time before.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br><br>
MRS. SINCLAIR PAYS A VISIT.
</h3>

<p>
Melville's absence from The Vale occurring
thus simultaneously with Sir Ross Buchanan's
defection made the time hang heavy on
Mrs. Sinclair's hands, and, her other visitors being
few, she suddenly found herself deprived of
all companionship.  It was not long before
this solitude became intolerable to her, and
as her repeated little notes to Melville
remained without an answer she determined to
go to call on him in person.  He, of course,
had duly received these several communications,
but as none of them contained the
news which he desired&mdash;that Sir Ross had
resumed his visits&mdash;he did not think that
any good purpose would be served by
prosecuting his attentions to his aunt.
</p>

<p>
As a consequence of his disaster at the
races he was obliged to economise again.
For breakfast, followed by luncheon at his
club or some good restaurant, he substituted
a meal which would in France be termed
<i>déjeûner</i>, but which he significantly labelled
"brunch," as being neither the one thing
nor the other, although compact of both.
Then in the afternoon he lounged by the
Achilles Statue, and played billiards if chance
threw in his way any acquaintance with
kindred tastes but less skill than his own.
And in the evening he would dine alone at
some one of the many cheap restaurants in
Soho, or have a chop in solitude at home.
The life was all right in a way, but aimless
and not to his taste.  Yet even he could not
bring himself to make fresh demands upon
his uncle until a more reasonable period
had elapsed.
</p>

<p>
It was after one of these purposeless
saunters in the Park that he went back to his
rooms.  The day had been very hot, and,
after letting down the sun-blinds, Melville
threw himself upon the sofa and idly blew
rings of smoke into the still air.  A pile of
illustrated papers lay within reach, syphons
and decanters stood upon a table at his
elbow, and he was just falling into a doze
when he heard a woman's voice, and in
another moment his valet opened the outer
door with his master-key and ushered
Mrs. Sinclair in.
</p>

<p>
Melville jumped to his feet and greeted
her effusively, checking her mixture of
apologies and reproaches with admirable tact.
</p>

<p>
"It was a case of Mahomet and the
mountain," she said.  "You didn't come and
didn't answer my letters&mdash;I never thought you
could be so abominably rude, Melville&mdash;and I
wanted to see you, so there was no help for
it but to disregard proprieties and come here.
Why don't you marry some charming girl,
so that I can call without being compromised
or compromising you?  You would be a
delightful husband."
</p>

<p>
"So I have been explaining," Melville
answered, "but the charming girl has the
bad taste to prefer somebody else.  Get
some tea, Jervis, and some strawberries and
things."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sinclair settled herself in a comfortable
chair, with her back to the light, and took
stock of her surroundings.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder how it is that bachelors always
have such delightful quarters?  This room
is an effective answer to the old sneer that no
place can be quite comfortable without a
woman's touch."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I'm a bit effeminate in my
tastes," Melville replied.  "Lots of musical
Johnnies are, you know.  How is Sir Ross
Buchanan?"
</p>

<p>
He switched off the conversation from
trifles to essentials with perfect ease, and
Mrs. Sinclair showed no resentment.
</p>

<p>
"He hasn't been near me since the day
you saw him," she answered.  "That is the
principal reason why I've called now.  Sir
Ross hasn't been to see me, nor have you,
and I'm being bored to death.  Why have
you stopped away, Melville?"
</p>

<p>
"I've had some business to attend to," he
said, "and it didn't turn up trumps.  And
now I'm a sick man&mdash;broke, and generally
down on my luck."
</p>

<p>
"All the more reason for you to avoid
your own company," she retorted.  "Moping's
no use to anybody.  Come and dine with me
to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"Delighted," said Melville, but without
enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"I'll get a box somewhere, and we'll
pretend we're going the pace.  My show,
you know," she added, thinking that the
expense might be inconvenient to him.
</p>

<p>
Melville liked the little touch of <i>camaraderie</i>.
</p>

<p>
"You're a good sort, Lavender," he said
approvingly.  "What a pity you and Sir
Geoffrey couldn't run together in double
harness!"
</p>

<p>
A slight frown crossed her brow.
</p>

<p>
"If you mourn over the pity of everything
you'll die of compassion," she remarked,
"and that's a silly sort of end for any man
to come to.  How is Sir Geoffrey?  Have
you seen him lately?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Melville, "but I am going to
Fairbridge to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Take me," said Mrs. Sinclair impulsively.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Lavender!" Melville said
aghast; "what on earth will you want me
to do next?"
</p>

<p>
He was not only astonished but alarmed
at the suggestion, for nothing could be
devised more fraught with danger to his
own schemes.  Yet he did not know what a
woman of Lavender's temperament might
not be capable of doing.  On her part, it is
true, Mrs. Sinclair had made the suggestion
on the spur of the moment, but, having once
made it, she was fascinated by it.  Possibly,
unrecognised by herself, there was in her
heart some remorse for the injury she had
done Sir Geoffrey, some hunger to set eyes
once more upon the man who, if old enough
to be her father, had nevertheless been her
husband; at all events, she insisted.
</p>

<p>
"Why should I not go?"
</p>

<p>
"You would save yourself an unpleasant
interview if you gave yourself up to the
police at once," Melville answered; "but, of
course, you are not serious.  Fancy putting
your head in the lion's mouth like that!"
and he laughed.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sinclair looked at him gravely.
</p>

<p>
"I've been doing nothing but think for a
week," she said, "and, do you know, I'm
really not sure that it would not be the best
thing for me to go to Sir Geoffrey and tell
him all about it.  I don't believe he would
prosecute me or even apply for a divorce.
Of course, I should have to come to terms
with the Sinclair lot, and Sir Geoffrey might
have to see me through any difficulty with
them.  But if I did that, he's just the sort of
man to take care that I should be no worse
off afterwards than I was before.  He always
respected people who did the square thing.
And as for the rest, he knows that if he fed
me I'm not the sort of reptile to sting his
bosom."
</p>

<p>
Melville grew more and more anxious, for
this mood was a difficult one to combat.
He affected to consider the point
sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"You may be right," he replied; "but
that's not the Sir Geoffrey whom I know.
He has always been most generous to me,
but I've never seen the soft side of the man.
He does respect people who do the square
thing, but, on the other hand, he never
forgives those who don't.  And he's as proud
as Lucifer."
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Lavender, and flushed.
</p>

<p>
Melville noted her heightened colour and
drew confidence from it.
</p>

<p>
"After you left him, Lavender&mdash;that
morning&mdash;all those years ago&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" she said, as Melville seemed to
hesitate.
</p>

<p>
"Well, how do you suppose he took it?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't possibly tell," she replied
impatiently, and Melville drove his advantage
further home; he would work upon her
imagination as much as he could.
</p>

<p>
"I can picture him so clearly," Melville
said meditatively.  "At first he was
angry&mdash;frightfully angry, and only thought of how
he would punish you when you came back.
Then, as you stayed away, he began&mdash;more to
save his own honour than for any other
reason&mdash;to invent explanations of your
absence, but all the time he was raging at having
been made a fool of by the child whom he
had honoured by marrying.  Then he began
to search for you, at first with the idea of
saving you from going to the devil, but
afterwards with the different idea that he might
be able to divorce you and put an end to
the whole miserable business.  But years
went by and you never came back, and the
little nine days' wonder was forgotten and
he inherited the title, and now he not only
hopes but believes that you are dead.  And
if you crop up again you'll hurt him in his
pride ten thousand times more than you
did when you left him, because then he was
nobody in particular, and now he's a baronet
and the best part of a millionaire, with a
big position and heaps of friends, all of whom
suppose him to be unmarried.  You will be
his dead past rising up like a ghost and ruining
him, and he will never forgive you.  Sir
Geoffrey never does forgive.  No, Lavender,
you will have to pay for what you've done;
pay to the uttermost farthing!"
</p>

<p>
There was silence for some moments, and
then the tension was broken by the valet
bringing in the tea-things, which he placed
by Mrs. Sinclair.  Melville rose and heaped
some strawberries on a plate, flanking them
with wafer-biscuits.
</p>

<p>
"It's a nice little world as it is," he said,
as if carrying on some trivial conversation
begun before the servant came into the room.
"People ought always to enjoy things as
they are.  That's not only good philosophy,
but a much easier one to put into practice
than is commonly supposed."
</p>

<p>
He drank the tea that Mrs. Sinclair gave
him, and waited until the valet noiselessly
disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" he said interrogatively.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you are right, as usual," she
answered, with some reluctance, and Melville
breathed more freely.  "I suppose it would
be madness to confess.  But can't I go with
you to-morrow, all the same?  You can
take me on the river and leave me somewhere
while you go to the house.  I promise
not to get in your way."
</p>

<p>
Melville did not care about the idea, but
having carried the point that was most
important, thought it might be politic to
conciliate the woman upon whose docility
so much depended.
</p>

<p>
"I will take you with pleasure," he said
cordially.  "We will get a boat at Shipton's,
near the old lock, and row up stream to the
Manor House.  I will leave you somewhere
near there, and after I've seen Sir Geoffrey
we will drift down in time to catch a train
at St. Martin's Hill."
</p>

<p>
"I'll take a luncheon basket," Mrs. Sinclair
said, her usual cheerfulness returning, "and
we'll make a picnic of it."
</p>

<p>
But when Melville had put her into a cab
and regained his cosy room, he shook his
head doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like it a little bit," he said moodily.
"Fancy my piloting that good lady up to
Fairbridge of all places in the world!  It
would be just my luck if Ralph and Gwen
were punting and spotted us, and Lavender
gave the show away.  Or Sir Geoffrey even
might see her, attired in the latest thing in
river costumes and looking as fit as a fiddle,
when he fondly imagines she's dying of
consumption in a garret in Hampstead.  It's a
jolly sight too dangerous to please yours
truly.  I hope to goodness it will rain cats
and dogs!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br><br>
A PICNIC.
</h3>

<p>
In spite of Melville's hope that rain might
come to prevent the proposed excursion up
the river, the following day dawned bright
and sunny, and as he stood by the front
door waiting for Mrs. Sinclair, who was to
call for him on her way to Waterloo, he was
conscious of the joy of mere existence that
comes to men sometimes.
</p>

<p>
Punctual to the minute Mrs. Sinclair arrived,
and before long the pair were at the boathouse
by St. Martin's Lock.  The boatman
was apologetic; there was a regatta six
miles up stream at Longbridge, and he could
only offer Melville the choice between a
Canadian canoe and a rather heavy boat;
all his other boats were engaged for the
whole day.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sinclair laughed.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to work for once," she said.
"I'm so sorry, but I cannot row at all, and
I'm not going to trust myself, and my frock,
and my luncheon to that canoe.  We'll have
the boat, please."
</p>

<p>
"Can you steer?" Melville asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not a little bit," she answered cheerfully;
"it doesn't matter, does it?"
</p>

<p>
"There'll be a rare pack higher up," the
boatman said to Melville, "but perhaps
you'll not be going so far as Longbridge?
If you do, and get into the crush, unship
your rudder altogether.  That'll be better
than running any risks of being run into by
any launches."
</p>

<p>
So the luncheon basket was transferred
to the boat, and with easy strokes Melville
sculled slowly up the stream.
</p>

<p>
"Better not try to steer at all," he
remarked, as they zigzagged from one bank
to the other.  "Keep the lines by you in case
I want your help, but while we have the
river to ourselves I can manage better alone.
Just tell me if there's anything coming down.
So:" he fastened the rudder lines loosely on
to the arms of Mrs. Sinclair's seat, and she,
with a sigh of satisfaction, opened her parasol
and resigned herself to the delicious spirit of
idleness which makes a day up the river
so enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
Nor could Melville fail to be glad that
they had come; he possessed the faculty of
getting the last ounce of pleasure out of
whatever he had in hand, and a <i>tête-à-tête</i>
with a charming and sympathetic woman in
a boat on a summer's day was peculiarly to
his taste.  He resolutely put out of his mind
all idea of possible complications if she should
chance to be seen by Sir Geoffrey, and determined
only to enjoy himself.
</p>

<p>
So he pulled indolently along, keeping
under the shady bank, and lingering sometimes
to pull a few wild flowers or to let his
companion snatch at the round heads of the
yellow lilies that seemed to evade her grasp
with such intelligent skill; she insisted upon
exploring every creek, however narrow, and
the morning passed in laughing idleness.
</p>

<p>
In one of these little creeks, about a mile
below Fairbridge, they found an ideal spot
for luncheon, and, making the boat secure
to the gnarled roots of a willow, Melville
unstrapped the basket and carried it ashore.
Mrs. Sinclair laid the cloth upon a level space
of turf, while Melville spread the cushions
from the boat to form easy couches for them.
He surveyed the preparations with much
satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"You are a perfect hostess, Lavender.
Chicken, and rolls, and, as I live, a salad!
How has that lettuce kept so cool, I wonder?"
</p>

<p>
"As I have, by the simple process of doing
nothing," she replied.  "Stand that Moselle
in the water, Melville, unless your thirst
won't allow you to wait."
</p>

<p>
"I don't wonder the basket was so heavy,"
he remarked, as he obeyed her.  "You've
brought a full-blown luncheon&mdash;and
trimmings.  Silver spoons, by gad!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you don't want to use tin ones just
because you're eating out of doors, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"There are other things," he argued;
"white metal, for instance.  What is white
metal?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't the least idea," she said.
"Mix the salad, and don't ask Mangnall's
questions.  The oil and vinegar are in those
little screw-stoppered bottles."
</p>

<p>
"If you're ever hard up you can start a
business to cater for picnic parties," Melville
suggested; "<i>Lavinie et Cie.</i>," or something
of that sort; "salads a <i>specialite</i>;" and you
can patent a luncheon basket full of cunning
little dodges like a dressing-case.  Are you
sure the salt isn't in your tooth-powder
bottle now?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite sure," Lavender answered.  "Fall
to, good sir, fall to."
</p>

<p>
The <i>al-fresco</i> luncheon was a great success,
and was supplemented by an early cup of
tea, and afterwards Melville lay upon his
back smoking cigarettes, while Lavender
threw crumbs of bread to the fish that
swarmed by the boat, and fought and leaped
over each other in greedy haste to make the
most of their unexpected treat.
</p>

<p>
It was very quiet in this creek, which was
separated from the main stream by a tongue
of land covered with trees and dense
undergrowth.  Upon the bank where Lavender
and Melville reclined, ground ivy and white
nettle grew in profusion, while willow-wort
and meadow-sweet overhung the stream,
and marsh marigolds flung back the sunlight
from their glorious blooms; behind them
flowering grasses and tufted rushes waved
in luxuriance, and behind again there rose a
screen of willows, flanked by silver birch and
tapering poplars.
</p>

<p>
The place and the hour alike seemed to
be pointed out for the exchange of tender
confidences and happy day-dreams, but for
the man, at any rate, the soft emotions had
no charm.  In the temple where money is
enshrined as a god there is no welcome, and,
indeed, no room, for love, and Melville
Ashley's heart was such a temple.  His
interview with his uncle was impending, and
the best use to which he could put this
peaceful interval was to ascertain how
Lavender Sinclair's own affairs were progressing.
</p>

<p>
He broke the silence which had fallen
upon them.
</p>

<p>
"What is happening about Sir Ross
Buchanan?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sinclair threw the last handful of
crumbs to the ravenous fish and leaned back
with a weary sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Can't we forget everything horrid today?"
she entreated.
</p>

<p>
"I can't," Melville answered; "besides,
the real object of this trip is my visit to Sir
Geoffrey, and&mdash;well, one thought leads to
another, you know.  Have you heard from
Sir Ross?"
</p>

<p>
"I told you yesterday I hadn't," she
replied; "but didn't we settle all this the
other day?  It was arranged that I should
tell you anything he said when he said it,
and in the meantime do nothing at all."
</p>

<p>
"I know," Melville said; "but a lot can
happen in a few days.  One thinks, for
instance."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes! one thinks!" Mrs. Sinclair
assented.
</p>

<p>
She seemed reluctant to pursue the subject,
and Melville thought it might be well to
give her a lead.  As a general rule he
refrained from making direct statements or
asking direct questions, for anything straight-forward
was foreign to his nature, but in the
present instance the objection was lessened
by his knowledge of his companion's story.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've been thinking," he said, "and,
among other things, thinking that perhaps
you ought to meet Sir Ross half way."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Half way about me," Melville answered,
avoiding her direct look.  "If he objects so
violently to my coming to your house I can
be less constant in my attendance, and you
won't be any worse off than you were before
you wrote to me.  I shall be, of course," he
added politely, "but that is my misfortune.
You needn't tell Sir Ross in so many words
that you have ordered me off your premises,
but he will think you have done so, and
everything will be&mdash;as you were, don't you
know."
</p>

<p>
He rolled a cigarette delicately between
his long fingers, focussing all his attention
upon the operation.
</p>

<p>
"That is impossible," she said coldly.
"Sir Ross only presumed to dictate because
he understood that I was engaged to him."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so," said Melville.
</p>

<p>
"Of course it's impossible that I should
marry him now."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" Melville enquired calmly.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" she echoed in astonishment.
"You told me yourself that my marriage
with Mr. Sinclair was invalid because Sir
Geoffrey was alive, and yet you ask me why
I can't marry Sir Ross!  I wronged one
man&mdash;in ignorance&mdash;but I have no intention
of wronging another deliberately.  I may
as well say, once and for all, that if Sir Ross
applies to me again I shall tell him that our
engagement is finally broken off."
</p>

<p>
"Why be so heroic?" Melville said.
"Millionaire baronets don't grow on
blackberry bushes."
</p>

<p>
"If they did I wouldn't pick them off,
now that you have enlightened me,"
Mrs. Sinclair answered.  "I'm not that sort."
</p>

<p>
"Sir Ross is an enormously rich man,"
Melville protested, "and is worth keeping; and, in
addition, Sir Geoffrey is a very old man, which
is another argument in favour of a less
drastic policy than the one that you suggest."
</p>

<p>
"You seem very keen on my becoming
Lady Buchanan."
</p>

<p>
"I am," said Melville.  "Candidly, I think
you will make a frightful mistake if you break
off the engagement, when a little temporising
would save the situation."
</p>

<p>
"Temporising won't go down with Sir
Ross," Mrs. Sinclair said shortly; "I know
him too well to try that on.  It must be
'yes' or 'no' with him.  It can't be 'yes,'
and as he will want all sorts of explanations
if it's 'no,' I shall get out of the difficulty
by not being at home to him.  If he writes,
I will consult you."
</p>

<p>
Melville was annoyed, for with his aunt
feloniously intermarried with Sir Ross
Buchanan, her former husband being still
alive, he would have been sure of a
substantial revenue; he wished he had been a
little less emphatic in his explanation of
the law of bigamy, and he was vexed with
himself for having made any mistake in his
game.
</p>

<p>
"You're not such a clever woman as I
take you for," he said, "if you can't manage
Sir Ross better than that.  Take my advice,
and go slow.  That's good advice ninety-nine
times out of a hundred, and better advice
the hundredth."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Sinclair shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"It's no good, Melville," she said gently.
"I've done harm enough as it is&mdash;wilfully,
if you like, as a child, ignorantly as a woman.
But I've got a conscience left, and I'm not
going to do any more harm deliberately;
and I don't intend to play fast and loose
with one man on the chance of another man
dying.  I mean what I say.  Now that you
have explained what my engagement to Sir
Ross Buchanan amounts to, it is 'o double f';
and now, don't let us talk about it any more."
</p>

<p>
She got up and began to pack up the
luncheon basket.  Melville got up, too, and
busied himself about the boat, rearranging
the cushions and getting things ready for
their further journey up to Fairbridge.  In
reality, he was not a little disconcerted by
the way his plans with regard to Mrs. Sinclair
threatened to be upset, and he was piqued to
think that he had not read her character
correctly.  Conscience was the last
complication he had expected to run up against,
but he was forced to recognise its existence
in this most unlikely quarter.  Well! it
rendered his visit to Sir Geoffrey all the
more necessary; if supplies were not to be
forthcoming from the one quarter, they must
be doubled from the other.
</p>

<p>
He stowed the hamper in the boat, and
helped Mrs. Sinclair back into her seat.
</p>

<p>
"I'm quite sorry to leave this shady nook,
for it's getting hotter every minute, but I
must get on to Fairbridge now.  Are you
ready to go?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite," she answered, and Melville
proceeded to back the boat down the creek,
pulling it along with the boat-hook and by
the help of the overhanging branches of the
trees.  In the main stream he got out the
sculls and paused a minute before setting
to work again.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't be surprised if there were a
storm," he remarked; "have you any cloak
or mackintosh with you?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Lavender anxiously, "and
my frock's a fair weather one.  Oh! don't
say it's going to rain."
</p>

<p>
"I won't, if you think that will make
any difference," said Melville with a smile,
and he began to row again.
</p>

<p>
There was no doubt, however, that a
storm was brewing, although it was possible
that it might break elsewhere; low down on
the horizon the sky was inky black, merging
through indescribable gradations of shade
into a lurid coppery glare overhead; the
breathless heat was oppressive, and Melville
was bathed in perspiration before they had
travelled a hundred yards.
</p>

<p>
"The sky is sitting on the top of my head,"
Mrs. Sinclair complained.  "Isn't there any
inn or cottage where we can put up, and
where I can wait while you are with Sir
Geoffrey?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid there isn't," Melville answered,
"but perhaps the storm will pass us by.
That often happens on the river."
</p>

<p>
"Fancy having the river so entirely to
ourselves," she said presently.  "I don't
think a single boat has passed us since we
started, and I know we haven't met any."
</p>

<p>
"That is because of the regatta at
Longbridge," Melville explained.  "If I had
known about it we might have gone there
to-day and I could have seen Sir Geoffrey
to-morrow; but, personally, I've enjoyed
what we have done immensely."
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, he had heard of the
Longbridge regatta with considerable relief,
for it removed most of the probability of
his being seen with Mrs. Sinclair by either
Ralph or Gwendolen.  Sir Geoffrey, too,
was still fond of boating, and might quite
possibly have seen them, which would have
been nothing short of a disaster.  As it was,
both Ralph and Gwendolen would certainly
be present at the regatta, perhaps competing
in some of the events, and Sir Geoffrey, if he
were upon the water at all, would be there
as well.  Nothing was happening to shake
Melville's faith in his star.
</p>

<p>
The intense atmospheric oppression was
beginning to tell upon Mrs. Sinclair, who
relapsed into complete silence.  Varying
emotions were conflicting in her mind as she
drew near the Manor House, of which she
might have been the mistress, but which
she dared not enter now.  After the lapse
of so many years she felt some remorse at
the thought of how she had spoiled Sir
Geoffrey's life, and she would have liked to
be able to convey some message to him
telling him she was sorry.  But fear stood
between her and confession, as it so often
stands, and sealed her lips until it was too
late.
</p>

<p>
Presently Melville drew the boat into the
bank.
</p>

<p>
"There is the Manor House garden, behind
those trees," he said, pointing to a row of
splendid elms some hundred, yards ahead.
"If you don't mind, I'll leave you here under
this great willow.  I'll fasten the boat so
that it can't drift away, and you won't get
wet, even if it does come on to rain."
</p>

<p>
He tied the boat up, bow and stern, with
the painter and rudder-lines, and gave her
the boathook to grapple to the twisted roots
of the willow if she felt uneasy.  She thanked
him with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be longer than you can help,
will you?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a minute longer," he replied, and
turned to leave her.  As he stepped ashore
he felt for the first time that day a pang of
anxiety at the risk he was running in bringing
her so close to the husband whom they had
both wronged so much.  He hesitated, and
looked at her searchingly.
</p>

<p>
"You will wait for me here, Lavender,
won't you?  You won't&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I will wait here all right," she answered,
and Melville forced his way through the
bushes that screened the meadows from the
stream, and was lost to view.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br><br>
MURDER.
</h3>

<p>
Sheltered by the leafy elms which Melville
had pointed out to Lavender was an oblong
inlet from the river, artificially constructed
by Sir Geoffrey Holt to serve as a private
bathing-place and as a landing-stage for the
Manor House grounds.  Here he had built a
chalet in an ornate Swiss style, one half being
devoted to the boats, the other containing
two large sitting-rooms.  The end room,
which overlooked the creek on one side, the
river on another, and the garden on a third,
and which was surrounded on these three
sides by a wide verandah, was a favourite
resort of Sir Geoffrey's, and it was here that
Melville hoped to find him this afternoon; if
things went badly with him and the interview
proved to be very quarrelsome, he would
prefer to have it away from the house, where
they would be less likely to be overheard.
</p>

<p>
His mind was quite made up.  He knew
that Lavender had been in earnest when she
said she would not marry Sir Ross Buchanan,
and he was mad with himself for having
stood in his own light by preventing the
marriage; had that been accomplished he
could have drawn upon her jointure to a
pretty tune.  He knew, too, that Sir Geoffrey
would not give him any more money for his
wife so soon; it only remained for him to
extort a payment on account for holding
his tongue.  His errand was blackmail, and
it might not be an easy task to levy it.  But
he was determined to get money to-day,
cost what it might.
</p>

<p>
Money!  Never had false god so devout a
worshipper, never had mistress so ardent a
wooer as money had in Melville Ashley.  He
loved it; but as the spendthrift, not the
miser.  To scatter it broadcast with both
hands was life to him, and he recked not how
he came by it so that he had it in unfailing
abundance; it meant gaiety and excitement
and irresponsibility, music and wine and
cards&mdash;everything that he summed up in
the comprehensive name of pleasure.  Honour
and self-respect were a small price to pay
for money which, in his opinion, could not
cost too much.  What was blackmail, after
all?  While Sir Geoffrey had a shilling left
and desired the story of his marriage to
remain untold, Melville would demand the
shilling or trumpet forth the news for the
delectation of a scandal-loving world.
</p>

<p>
And if Sir Geoffrey refused and bid him
do his utmost?  Where would the money
come from then?  The question framed
itself in Melville's thoughts, and his brow
darkened, but he dismissed it carelessly again,
for as yet Sir Geoffrey seemed inclined to
prefer being robbed to being exposed.
</p>

<p>
Melville gained the grounds and turned
down towards the chalet.  His rubber-soled
canvas shoes were noiseless on the well-rolled
paths, and he walked briskly into the boat-house,
of which the wooden doors stood open.
It was empty&mdash;punt and dinghy, pair-oar and
canoe, all were gone.  Evidently Sir Geoffrey,
with customary good-nature, had allowed
most of the servants to share in the
amusement afforded by the regatta, and until
dinner-time the Manor House would be in
charge of some of the kitchenmaids.  So
much the better, if there was to be a quarrel
in the house.  But was Sir Geoffrey in the
house, or was he here in the garden-room?
</p>

<p>
Melville walked along the verandah, treading
softly.  Overhead, the lurid sky grew
more lurid, the still oppression more still and
oppressive.  A great drop of rain fell on the
asphalte boat-slide, making a mark as big as
a shilling; another fell, and, after an interval,
another; the storm was going to break upon
him, and he must hasten upon his business.
</p>

<p>
Through the window he caught sight of
Sir Geoffrey sitting in a low wicker chair,
with an illustrated paper in his hand.
Melville's lips tightened as he marked the figure
of his uncle, so unconscious of the presence
of another person, so attuned to the atmosphere
of this rich home of his.  Sir Geoffrey's
back was towards him, and Melville, with
some idea of the fitness of making his entrance
from the front, so to speak, walked quickly
round the verandah, and, flinging open the
French windows with both hands, stepped
into the room.  For a second the two men
eyed each other, and then Sir Geoffrey spoke
in a tone of studied evenness.
</p>

<p>
"So it is you, Melville.  Have you come
down for the regatta?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Melville bluntly.  "I want
to see you."
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey picked up the paper again
and affected to be more interested in it than
in the conversation.
</p>

<p>
"Want to see me, do you?  On business?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; on business," Melville answered, a
little nettled by his uncle's nonchalance.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said Sir Geoffrey, and paused.
"Whose business is it this time?" he
enquired presently.  "Are you principal or
agent on this occasion?"
</p>

<p>
His affectation of being rather bored by
the whole thing emphasised the affront and
brought the blood to Melville's cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Principal," he replied laconically, and,
unasked, sat down.
</p>

<p>
"That simplifies the issue," said Sir
Geoffrey, laying down one paper and picking
up another.  "Go on, man; say what you want.
You are not usually lacking in effrontery."
</p>

<p>
Melville was always conscious of his own
meanness when he was in his uncle's presence,
always found it difficult to face the steady
eyes and honest scorn of the old man; it
was characteristic of him, too, that he always
felt at a disadvantage unless in a struggle of
wits he was able to make his opponent,
whoever he might be, lose his temper first,
and he could seldom do this with Sir Geoffrey.
He grew hot and angry now under the lash
of the bitter sarcasm in the coldly spoken
words, but they had the effect of bringing
him to the point.
</p>

<p>
"I've come down again for some money,"
he said coarsely.
</p>

<p>
"What is the lie to-day?" Sir Geoffrey
enquired.  "Has Ralph been tapping you again?
Don't strain your imagination too much."
</p>

<p>
"I won't," said Melville.  "I want some
more money for myself, and I think you
will give it me."
</p>

<p>
"I shall do nothing of the kind," said Sir
Geoffrey; "you presume too much."  He
closed his lips with a snap, but as Melville
did not reply at once, he went on in the
same even tone that exasperated his nephew
so intensely.  "I tell you what I will do,
Melville, if you like.  After all, if I am to
pay the piper I have some right to suggest
the tune.  I will give you an allowance on
condition that you stop away altogether."
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?" said Melville.
</p>

<p>
"Give you an allowance to be drawn by
yourself at regular intervals, so that you
will be spared the trouble of making these
irregular applications."
</p>

<p>
Melville was completely deceived by the
way his uncle spoke.  He considered the
proposal seriously, as he believed it to be
made.
</p>

<p>
"How much will you make it?"
</p>

<p>
"Ten pounds a month, to be drawn in
person at, say, Botany Bay," said Sir Geoffrey,
looking at him over the top of the paper.
</p>

<p>
Melville was furious, and only kept control
over himself by an effort.
</p>

<p>
"You are pleased to be facetious," he
replied, "but I warn you I am not in the
mood to enjoy a joke to-day.  Fortunately,
I am in a position to suggest terms as well.
I know something which you want kept
dark.  Having seen the lady, I'm not
surprised at your desire to suppress the fact
of her existence, for she is not an ideal
ornament for the head of your table.  I will
accept a hundred and twenty pounds now, and
hold my tongue about her while that lasts."
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey betrayed no anger.
</p>

<p>
"Blackmail?" he said enquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Melville.  "The word is of
your own choosing.  Indeed, I'm indebted
to you for putting the idea into my head.
But a man who holds his tongue when it
would pay him to talk may not be a
blackmailer, but is most certainly a fool."
</p>

<p>
"You are not a fool," said Sir Geoffrey,
"but you are a knave.  Now, since I last
had the misfortune of seeing you I've had
time to think, and the result of my meditation
may be of interest to you.  Do you wish me
to speak plainly?"
</p>

<p>
"Pray do."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Sir Geoffrey, "when you
first told me that Lady Holt was alive I
confess I was very much surprised.  I believed
she had died years before; I don't know
what she may have said to you, but it is the
fact that the marriage was unhappy.  Nobody
about here had ever heard of it, and I
wanted to save myself from being a topic of
common gossip.  What did I do?  I accepted
your story, and gave you some money to
relieve her from the immediate distress in
which you allege you found her.  I suppose
she received that sum?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course she did," said Melville.
</p>

<p>
"You know I distrust you entirely," Sir
Geoffrey proceeded.  "I had&mdash;still have&mdash;my
doubts about your story, and I saw at
once that you intended to convert my natural
wish to avoid a scandal into money for
yourself.  Now I have resolved on my policy;
I ought to have resolved on it at first.  If
Lady Holt needs permanent assistance, she
must apply to Mr. Tracy, who will have my
instructions.  Tell her that from me.  She
is my wife, and she need have no fear in
applying to her husband or his solicitor.
But she will never have another farthing
from me through you.  I don't trust you;
and if I did, I still should not employ you in
this matter.  And as for the blackmail,
Melville, you have made a mistake in your
calculations.  I don't intend to be blackmailed."
</p>

<p>
"You don't mind your marriage becoming
known?"
</p>

<p>
"I won't pay you to keep it secret," said
Sir Geoffrey proudly.  "The marriage was a
failure, but it was a marriage, and I have
nothing to be ashamed of in it.  I was a
fool to hesitate when you were down here
last, but now I hesitate no more.  I don't
care what you do.  Talk if you like.  Sell
the news to <i>The Fairbridge Mercury</i> for
half-a-crown, if you can; I won't give you five
shillings to suppress it.  And now, sir, go!"
</p>

<p>
His passion had been steadily rising, and
as he shouted out the last word the old man
jumped up from his chair and with
outstretched arm pointed to the window.  It
was getting very dark, and suddenly the
threatening storm burst in a torrent of
heavy rain; it rattled on the zinc roof of the
verandah with the noise of musketry, leaping
up from the asphalte in white sheets and
flooding all the gullies; then a blinding flash
of lightning seemed to fill the room, and
Melville sank back in his chair, hiding his
eyes and waiting for the thunder, which
swiftly followed like a roar of artillery.
When the crash died away, Melville rose and
faced his uncle, who had not moved a muscle.
</p>

<p>
"It's to be war between us?" he said.
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"I don't fight with blackguards," he
answered.  "Do your worst; do what you
please&mdash;but go."
</p>

<p>
Melville knew that he had lost; his second
castle in the air was shattered and he could
not hope to build it up again.  Mrs. Sinclair
had destroyed the first, Sir Geoffrey had
destroyed the second, and Melville was once
more face to face with ruin.  Outside the
wind had risen and the hail was beating into
the room, streaming down the windows and
blurring all the view.  In horrible succession
flash of lightning followed flash of lightning,
silhouetting everything in the room for an
instant before darkness, made more horrible
by the deafening crashes of thunder, engulfed
it all again.  And swift as the lightning that
blazed and then was gone, thoughts and
schemes shot through Melville's brain.  If
only Sir Geoffrey were dead, struck by the
jagged blades of flame that tore down from
the storm-centre in the sky above them,
everything would be well.  He had made no
will&mdash;he had said so&mdash;and if only he were
dead there would be salvation for Melville&mdash;salvation
in the share of his uncle's money
which the law would give him.
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey strode towards him.
</p>

<p>
"Storm or no storm," he shouted, striving
to make himself heard above the din of wind
and hail and thunder, "go.  I disown you for
the liar and swindler and blackmailer that you
are.  Not one shilling more shall you ever have
whether for my wife or for yourself.  Go!"
</p>

<p>
He seized Melville by the shoulder, and
in an instant the men were locked together.
Melville was taken by surprise, and even if
he had not been he was not more than a
match for his uncle, in spite of the difference
in their ages.  For one brief moment they
swayed together, Sir Geoffrey wrestling to
throw his nephew out, Melville wrestling to
free himself from his uncle's grasp.  Another
roar of thunder shook the chalet, and even as
it did so, the end came.  Melville, twisted
backwards by his uncle's weight, felt the
pistol that he always carried hurt his side.
Mad with passion he freed one hand somehow
and struggled half an arm's length from
the elder man.  Before the thunder had
fairly died away there was a barking report,
a film of smoke rose between the swaying
figures, and Sir Geoffrey threw up his arms
and dropped.  A smell of singed cloth seemed
to fill the room, and on the white front of the
old man's flannel shirt there was a burnt
stain.  Sir Geoffrey Holt was dead&mdash;shot at
close quarters through the heart.
</p>

<p>
As Sir Geoffrey fell a sharp scream rang
outside, and Melville, with wildly beating
heart, looked across the room to the window
through which he had caught sight of his
uncle.  A woman was clinging to one of the
iron pillars that supported the verandah, and
in the half-fainting form Melville recognised
Lavender Sinclair.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br><br>
THE FINDING OF THE BODY.
</h3>

<p>
Scared by the fearful intensity of the storm,
all the people flocked away from Longbridge
regatta, those who could manage to find
room there hurrying in to the single inn the
place possessed, while, of those who could
not, some invaded the houseboats along the
bank, and others, more bold, and in reality
more wise, made the best of a bad business
and started for home.  Among these last
were Ralph and Gwendolen.  He wrapped
her up as well as circumstances allowed, and
then, cramming his cap upon his head and
seizing his punt pole, began to work for all
he was worth.  Gwendolen did not speak.
She was not a little frightened by the lightning,
which appeared to flash backwards and
forwards between the earth and sky, and
there seemed every chance that the racing
punt in which they were would be swamped;
not that she could have got much wetter if
it were; the rain was thrashing the river
and flooding the punt and she was already
drenched to the skin, but, at any rate, she
was speeding towards shelter and dry clothes.
</p>

<p>
Behind her Ralph was straining every
nerve.  His thin cashmere shirt clinging
damply to him showed every muscle on his
chest and shoulders, and his arms, bare to
the elbows, shone with the wet, the sinews
standing out like cords.  He, too, was nervous
on her account, and breathed a prayer of
gratitude as after each blinding shaft of
lightning he found her still unhurt.  With
set jaws and stern eyes he used all his skill
and strength, taking advantage of his
thorough knowledge of the river to find the
best course for the punt, and listening with a
grim satisfaction to the water slapping
underneath his feet.
</p>

<p>
He must have covered the three miles
from Longbridge in record time, and of the
crowd of boats that hurried down the stream
but few succeeded in outstripping him.  As
he came to the Manor House he shot the punt
dexterously alongside of his houseboat, and,
jumping on to it, helped Gwendolen to alight.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be afraid, dear," he shouted,
making himself heard with difficulty against
a crashing peal of thunder; "run home and
change your things at once."
</p>

<p>
"And you?" she called back to him.
</p>

<p>
"I will take the punt into the boathouse
and wait there.  I have plenty of dry things
in the dressing-room.  I'll change and come
up when the storm is over."
</p>

<p>
He handed her down the gangway, and
stood for a moment watching her as she
sped across the lawn.  Once at The Grange
he knew she would be all right; a fond
mother and devoted servants would have
prepared a cheerful fire and warm garments
for her as soon as they saw the persistency of
the rain, and afternoon tea would soon restore
her equanimity.  Then he got back into the punt
and took it round the bend into the creek.
</p>

<p>
He stepped ashore and, laying the soaked
cushions under the shelter of the verandah,
tipped up the punt to empty it of the water
it had shipped, drew it up into the
boat-house, and went into the dressing-room.  It
was a well-appointed place, with every
convenience for men who take their boating
seriously.  In one corner stood a shower
bath, and against it a full-size bath supplied
with hot water by a lightning geyser.  Divesting
himself of his dripping flannels, he lighted
the lamp in the geyser and employed the
few minutes intervening before it should
get warm by rubbing himself down.  Then
he had a bath, followed by a cold douche,
and again rubbed himself with rough towels
until he glowed with warmth.  From a big
press in another corner he took a clean shirt
and socks and a spotless suit of flannels, and,
finally, feeling splendidly fit and comfortable,
turned towards the inner room, meaning to
have a cigarette and some spirits, and wait
there until the fury of the tempest should abate.
</p>

<p>
"Suppose Sir Geoffrey was here when the
storm broke," he thought, as he saw the
open windows, "and thought he would be
safer in the house.  It was careless of him
not to shut the windows; those curtains
are simply drenched!"
</p>

<p>
He closed the window overlooking the
creek and turned to cross to those that
opened on to the grounds, but as he walked
round the table that filled the centre of the
room a cry rang from his lips, for prone upon
the floor Sir Geoffrey lay, and something in
the utter helplessness of the posture of the
body told Ralph that he was dead.
</p>

<p>
"Good God!" he cried, and in an instant
dropped on his knees by the side of the still
figure, conquering by an immense effort a
feeling of positive repugnance against touching
death.  He felt his uncle's wrist to see if he
could detect a pulse, and uttered another
exclamation of horror when, on letting go
the dead hand, it dropped with a thud upon
the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Geoffrey!" he called; "Uncle
Geoffrey!" but no answer came; there was
not a quiver in the lids that bagged over the
already glazing eyes.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it was his own lack of skill that
prevented him from feeling the pulse; there
could scarcely be any room for doubt if he
felt the heart.  Sir Geoffrey was lying on
his left side, and Ralph rolled the body on to
its back and unfastened the flannel collar.
Again the horror of it all shook him, and he
turned his head aside as he slipped his hand
inside his uncle's shirt.  The body was quite
warm, and Ralph's pluck was returning with
his hope, when his fingers fell upon the little
wound and became sticky with blood; in a
frenzy of terror he tore open the shirt and
forced himself to look.  A sob shook his
whole frame.
</p>

<p>
"It is murder! it is murder!  Dear God,
don't let him be dead!" but the singed
flannel, the tiny hole in the centre of a ring
of scorched flesh, and the absence of blood
in any quantity, told a tale he could not but
believe.  Yet he must try to recall some
glimmer of consciousness before he could
leave the old man alone.  He poured some
brandy into a tumbler, and raising Sir
Geoffrey's head put a little into the mouth
that lolled open and gave the face an almost
idiotic expression; but the brandy merely
dribbled out from the corners of the lips,
and there was no sign of meaning in the eyes.
Not knowing what else to do, Ralph raised
Sir Geoffrey's body to lay it on the bamboo
couch, but, strong as he was, he only did it
with the utmost difficulty, and in making
the effort he smeared his sleeves and breast
with blood.
</p>

<p>
"What can I do?" he kept on muttering,
and yet, oddly enough, the idea of rushing
to the house and sending for the nearest
doctor never entered his mind.  In a hopeless,
incapable way he stared about him, wondering
what else he could do to recall the life he yet
felt sure had flown, and then, draining the
tumbler which he had partly filled, he closed
the French windows and went back to his
dressing-room.  He took off his blood-stained
jacket and flung it down by the press,
washed the blood from his hands, and found
another coat; and then, locking the boat-house
door, rushed out into the verandah, and
so into the garden, and stumbled to the house.
</p>

<p>
Going into the library he rang the bell,
and strode impatiently up and down until a
servant came.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Martin?  I want Martin.  Send
Martin here at once," he said rapidly to the
maid who, to his surprise, appeared in place
of the old butler.
</p>

<p>
She stared at him in astonishment and
some dismay, for he was white as death
himself, and all his wonted quietness of
manner was gone.
</p>

<p>
"He's only just got back from Longbridge,
sir," the maid replied, "and he's in his room
changing his clothes; they've all got dripping
wet."
</p>

<p>
"Tell him I want him at once&mdash;at once,"
said Ralph, and, eyeing him curiously, the
girl hurried downstairs.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ralph wants you in the library
directly minute," she called to Martin through
his door.  "He's rarely put out about something.
Gracious! there's the bell again."
</p>

<p>
"Say I'll be up in a minute," Martin
called back.
</p>

<p>
"But I daren't go back," the servant said.
"I'm sure something terrible's the matter.
He looks as white as white, and spoke to me
as never was."
</p>

<p>
Martin would have delivered himself of a
kindly admonition to the girl to mend her
manner of speech, but yet another peal of
the bell convinced him that something was
indeed amiss, and giving a tug at his tie to
make it assume some semblance of a bow, he
hurried out of his bedroom and up the stairs,
putting on his coat and waistcoat as he went.
</p>

<p>
"Beg your pardon, Mr. Ralph, for keeping
you waiting," he began, but a glance at
Ralph's face checked the apologies.  "What
is the matter, sir?  Has there been an
accident?  Miss Gwendolen&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"It's Sir Geoffrey," Ralph replied, hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
"Not dead?" the butler cried, stepping
forward with outstretched hands.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dead," answered Ralph.  "Murdered,
foully murdered in his own home."
</p>

<p>
Martin reeled against the writing table
and stared in horror at Ralph.  Ralph, in
his turn, gave way, and leaning his arm upon
the mantelpiece hid his face and ground his
teeth to keep back the tears.  So they
remained in silence, while the tall clock
hammered out the seconds of the time that
for its owner had ceased to be.
</p>

<p>
"Where?" whispered Martin.
</p>

<p>
Ralph jerked his head in motion to the
window.
</p>

<p>
"In the boathouse," he said.
</p>

<p>
He seemed incapable of doing anything
practical, and Martin rose to the occasion.
</p>

<p>
"You are sure it is&mdash;all over?  Quite sure
that he is dead?"
</p>

<p>
"Someone has shot him through the heart,"
said Ralph, in cold and measured tones.
</p>

<p>
Martin wiped his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps there is a chance.  God grant
there may be!  Will you run for the doctor,
sir, while I go down to him?  I'll just tell
the housekeeper to get Sir Geoffrey's room
in order and have the young servants out of the
way, and I'll be at the boathouse with some of
the men to carry him home.  The poor master!"
</p>

<p>
Ralph did as he was bid, glad to accept
a subordinate place, and Martin, with tears
running down his cheeks, hastened to give
his instructions to the housekeeper.  Then,
taking some cushions from the servants'
hall, he hurried into the stables to summon
help; a couple of long shutters were procured
to serve as a litter presently, and in a
few minutes the group of awestruck men
reached the scene of the tragedy.
</p>

<p>
It was while they were waiting for Ralph
to come with the doctor and bring the key
of the boathouse that the necessity of calling
in the police occurred to Martin.
</p>

<p>
"Run up to the police-station," he said
to one of the stable boys, "and ask the
inspector to come down with you sharp.
Whether Sir Geoffrey is dead or not we
won't lose any time in putting the police on
the scoundrel's track.  Go straight up and
come straight back, and don't get talking
to anybody else.  We don't want all the
town swarming down here."
</p>

<p>
The storm was dying.  Rain still fell and
thunder still rumbled in the distance, but
the heavy atmospheric oppression was gone,
and bird life was beginning to make itself
audible again.  In silence the men waited
under the verandah for the doctor, from
whose advent they still hoped for some
relief.  Presently he came, grave and with
lips compressed, for he knew and loved Sir
Geoffrey.  Ralph came, too, even more
haggard than before, and unlocking the door
led the way into the inner room.  But
although the doctor seemed to the bystanders,
in their anxiety, to take a long time over
his examination, the first glance had in
reality been enough to satisfy his trained
eye that Sir Geoffrey was beyond all human
aid.  As he turned to Ralph and sorrowfully
shook his head, the police superintendent
walked swiftly and quietly into the room, and
looked first at the body and then at the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Is it all over, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"All over," said the doctor very sadly.  "If
I had been here at the time I could have done
nothing.  This is a matter for you, inspector."
</p>

<p>
The inspector looked at the tell-tale mark
upon the shirt where the flame had scorched
it, and then looked inquiringly at the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the doctor, understanding
the unspoken question; "it is murder."
</p>

<p>
The inspector turned away.
</p>

<p>
"Who found the body?"
</p>

<p>
"I did," Ralph replied.
</p>

<p>
"Then with your permission I will come
up to the house when I have just looked
round and locked up the place," the inspector
said, and Ralph went out with the doctor.
Thus left in command, the inspector's manner
changed.  He cleared the room of all save
Martin Somers, and carefully noted all the
little details: the closed windows, the position
of the furniture, the empty tumbler on the
table.  In the dressing-room he saw the
water in the basin just stained with blood,
and in the corner by the press the
blood-stained shirt and jacket which Ralph had
just changed, his wet sweater and blazer
and soaked flannel trousers hanging upon
the side of the big bath where he had left
them to dry.  Next, the inspector made a
careful search all round the boathouse, but
the almost tropical rain had obliterated all
footsteps, and no clue remained outside.
When he at length was satisfied, he summoned
the stablemen, and, improvising a litter of
the two shutters, lashed together across the
boathooks from the canoe, they reverently
laid Sir Geoffrey's body on it and bore all
that remained of the fine old gentleman back
to the beautiful home of which he had been
so proud and beloved a master.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br><br>
FLIGHT.
</h3>

<p>
Had Ralph not lingered on the houseboat to
see that Gwendolen crossed the garden in
safety he must almost have taken his brother
red-handed in what was tantamount to
parricide.  That fearful peal of thunder
against the din of which he shouted to her
to run quickly home, marked the point in
time when Melville fired the shot that took
his uncle's life.  Great tragedies often take
but seconds in the acting, and in this supreme
moment in Melville's life of crime deed
followed thought and thought followed deed
as swiftly as the lightning shafts that burst
from the riven sky and tore down into the
bosom of the earth.
</p>

<p>
In a sense, he was conscious of a sort of
elemental grandeur in his position that yet
was wholly diabolical; it was as if all the
spirits of evil had sped from the furthest
confines of hell and, borne on the pinions of
the storm, had foregathered at that lonely
spot to become incarnate in him for one
brief instant of concentrated passion; but,
that brief instant gone, they had departed
from him again and sped away, shrieking
with fiendish glee at leaving him to reawaken
to human consciousness, and face the fact
that he was a murderer whose crime had
been overseen.
</p>

<p>
That was the dominant fact in Melville's
mind&mdash;Lavender had been a witness of the
murder.  What measures to take to secure
her silence he must decide presently; the
immediately urgent matter was to get away
unseen.  Casting one rapid, comprehensive
glance all round the room to satisfy himself
that he had left no damning trace behind
him, and incidentally photographing the scene
upon his highly sensitised brain, he stepped
noiselessly out of the boathouse and grasped
Lavender by the wrist.
</p>

<p>
"Come," he said curtly and incisively.
She shuddered as she felt his touch, but
relaxed her hold upon the iron pillar and
looked fearfully in his eyes.  "Come," he
said again, and she obeyed him.  Still holding
her firmly by the wrist he led her to the far
end of the creek and helped her over the
ha-ha.  As he did so, she dropped her
handkerchief, and Melville, picking it up, put it in
his pocket.  "I'll give that back to you at
Waterloo," he said with grim humour.  "We
can't afford to be so careless here."
</p>

<p>
Across the meadow they broke into a run,
and, reaching the river bank, forced their
way through the bushes and regained the
boat.  There Lavender collapsed, and
breaking into nervous hysterical sobs, begged
Melville not to push off into the open stream.
She seemed, indeed, to have lost all
self-control, and Melville hesitated, wondering
if her condition would attract attention.
But that was a smaller risk than for him to
be found in the neighbourhood if the discovery
of Sir Geoffrey's body were followed by an
immediate and exhaustive search; so he
contented himself with the assertion of his
mastery of will, and for the moment tried
to reassure her.
</p>

<p>
"There is no more danger on the open
water than there is under these trees," he
said, "if so much.  See, I will move the
stroke seat and row up in the bows.  Then
you can lie down and hide your eyes so as
not to see the lightning."  He made her as
comfortable as he could, covering her with
his coat and waistcoat; then he shoved off,
and with firm, strong strokes lifted the boat
along, while Lavender crouched down on the
cushions and hid her face from the horror of
the storm.
</p>

<p>
And as he rowed, his mind worked as
methodically as his arms and legs, the
measured thud of the sculls against the
rowlocks seeming to have a soothing effect
upon his excited imagination.  Possibly it
was due to something akin to demoniacal
possession, but whatever its originating
source might be there was not a little to
compel admiration in the determined way
this man could control his thinking powers,
could face danger, however imminent, and
utilise all his ingenuity in devising means
of escape.
</p>

<p>
In the time required to row from Fairbridge
to St. Martin's Lock he surveyed the
whole situation.  He reflected that the storm
would break up the Longbridge regatta, that
some of the inmates of the Manor House
would find Sir Geoffrey lying dead in his
summer room and raise a hue and cry, and
that as soon as the first shock of the discovery
was over they would telegraph for Mr. Tracy
and himself.  In order, therefore, to avoid
having to invent any circumstantial story of
his own movements, it was essential that he
should, if possible, get into his rooms unseen,
so that his wet flannels might not betray
where he had been, and be there when the
telegram arrived.  Could that be arranged he
might be able, if the worst came to the
worst, to set up an <i>alibi</i> successfully, and the
Fairbridge murder would be numbered among
the unsolved mysteries of crime.  As for
Lavender, something would depend upon
the severity of the storm in London.
Provided she held her tongue as to her
movements, suspicion was most unlikely to fall
upon her, at any rate for some time, and
the danger of her being sought for as Lady
Holt was remote; and, if she were, she would
certainly not be a consenting party to the
identification, because of the consequent
inevitable exposure of her bigamous marriage
and the rupture with Sir Ross Buchanan
which that exposure would entail.
</p>

<p>
Melville looked at his companion lying
huddled at the bottom of the boat.  Could
he rely upon her not betraying him?  What
line should he take with her when presently
the scene that had to be got over between
them should begin?  He could not quite
decide; it was difficult to do so until he
saw her face.  But for the moment he was
glad that she should cower down as she
was doing; it rendered her chance of being
recognised so much the less, and already
boat-loads of soaked holiday-makers were
passing them.  Melville paused as a favourable
opportunity offered, and surreptitiously
dropped his revolver into the river-bed.
If&mdash;anything&mdash;should happen, that must not be
found amongst his possessions, for the bullet
it had held would certainly be kept, and
such a coincidence as his possessing a weapon
which it fitted must be prevented.  He
kept his head down as he sculled and looked
neither to the right nor to the left.  To the
lock-keeper from whom he had hired the
boat he was a stranger, and all he had to do
was to avoid being recognised himself by
any acquaintance who might chance to be
in the crowd that now was nearing the lock
simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
He drew in to the left bank and let the
lock fill up.  The rain, which had been savage
and relentless while they were on the river,
was abating now they were within easy
reach of shelter; the intervals between the
peals of thunder were lengthening, and,
most noticeable of all, the terrible oppression
was relieved.  Melville hooked the boat on
to the stakes below the lock and backed her
gently up the stream until he came to a spot
where they could land easily.
</p>

<p>
"Sit up, Lavender," he said softly, but
peremptorily.
</p>

<p>
She raised herself on one arm and looked
round.  Hopelessness stared from her large
eyes, but Melville saw with relief that the
insane terror had departed from them; he
was anxious to get her into the train without
exciting remark, and it was something that
she had regained her self-control.  That her
frock was dripping wet and stained red from
the cushions would not attract attention here
where everyone was wet, and before they
reached Waterloo she would not look so
deplorable, however cold and uncomfortable
she might feel.
</p>

<p>
"We won't go through the lock," he
said.  "I'm going to pay the man for the
boat and say he'll find her here.  Pull
yourself together as much as you can before I
come back.  If we are quick I think we
can just catch a train, and we shall get
away before all the people get out of the
lock and crowd up the station.  Do you feel
better now?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answered dully.
</p>

<p>
"I can depend upon you until we get
home?" he asked, with some anxiety.
</p>

<p>
She nodded a vacant assent, and with that
he had to be satisfied.  He got out of the
boat and went to the lock to pay for its hire
and tell the man where to find it.  Meantime,
Lavender, realising that whatever the future
might have in store for her, no good could be
done by a scene at St. Martin's Lock, made
an effort to pull herself together, and tried
to readjust her bedraggled costume.  With
one of the napkins from the hamper she
dried her face and hands, and wringing some
of the water from her skirts and rubbing her
patent shoes, she succeeded in making herself
a little more presentable.  Melville was
pleased.  They hurried to the station and
were fortunate enough to catch an up train
and secure an empty carriage.
</p>

<p>
But as soon as the train moved away his
manner changed.  Even if they were left
alone during the whole journey they only
had fifty-five minutes in which to arrive at an
understanding, for he was quite clear he could
not go back with her to The Vale.  He took
the corner seat immediately opposite to her.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you leave the boat at Fairbridge?"
</p>

<p>
The question sprang sharply from his lips,
insisting on an immediate reply.
</p>

<p>
"The storm was so awful&mdash;so appalling,"
she said faintly.  "It was like the end of
the world."
</p>

<p>
It was obvious to Melville that she was
frightened of him, and he was content that
it should be so, for only by terrorising her
could he hope to maintain his ascendency
over her; any woman might be nervous at
being shut up in a railway carriage with a
murderer, but it was not of that precisely
that she was afraid, for she stood in no fear
of violence at his hands.  There was
something despotic about him that compelled
obedience, and even if she had not been
naturally as truthful as she was she would
not have attempted to prevaricate.
</p>

<p>
"Now tell me," Melville rapped out in the
same peremptory way, "did you hear what
we were saying in that room?"
</p>

<p>
"Some of it," she replied; "enough, at
any rate, to know what you have been doing
to get money."
</p>

<p>
"You don't know what my position was,"
Melville said.  "You remember my leaving
Monte Carlo&mdash;ruined?"  Lavender nodded.
"I went down to see my uncle a few days
after I got home and he refused to help me.
I don't know why.  He had always been
lavish to my brother, and had never refused
me anything before.  I was in absolute need
of shillings, and had to get them somehow.
After I heard of your marriage with him, I
told him I knew and got something from
him."
</p>

<p>
"But you got it on the ground that I was
in need of it," she said indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"It was the only way I could get it at
all," he retorted.
</p>

<p>
"It was an outrage," she said, with
suppressed passion.  "I resent that as much
as anything else.  After all the years I never
touched a penny of his money for you to tell
him I was starving and pocket the money
for yourself is a thing you can't expect me
not to be mad about."
</p>

<p>
Her eyes blazed from her white face, and
Melville grew apprehensive.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think Sir Geoffrey's answer
was?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"He gave me ten pounds as an act of
charity, and said if you needed any more you
could apply to the people you'd been living
with all those years.  So you see, if you had
been starving, you need not have looked for
much help from him."
</p>

<p>
A flush shot over her neck and cheeks and
ebbed again.
</p>

<p>
"It only makes it worse that your villainy
provoked such a message&mdash;such a gratuitous
affront.  Oh, what an incredible fool I have
been!  But I am beginning to see you in
your true colours now."
</p>

<p>
Melville looked at her, shading his eyes
with his hand; it might not be so easy to
silence her after all.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do?"
</p>

<p>
"How can I say?" she protested.  "I
must have time.  I can't even think yet."
</p>

<p>
"You must think," he retorted curtly.
"You must make up your mind between
this and Waterloo, and stick to it afterwards."
</p>

<p>
"I can't," she repeated.  "What's more,
I won't try."  Her thoughts flashed back
from themselves to the dead man.  "Why
did you do it?" she sobbed.  "Why, in the
name of heaven, did you do it?"
</p>

<p>
For just one moment a pang of remorse
stabbed Melville's heart.
</p>

<p>
"Only the devil knows," he groaned; but
the train was travelling rapidly, and this
was no time for vain reflection.  "You must
assure me, Lavender.  I must know that I
can have confidence in you.  After all, we're
in this thing together."
</p>

<p>
A look of fear came into her face, to be
noted instantly by him.
</p>

<p>
"What have I to do with it?" she said
defiantly.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," he answered swiftly.  "I want
your oath that you know nothing of it."
</p>

<p>
She threw out her hands with a pathetic
gesture.
</p>

<p>
"I can't give it.  I'm not sure of myself.
I can't live and be sure of not betraying it.
I shall never sleep&mdash;never know peace again."
</p>

<p>
"I want your oath," Melville said doggedly.
"After all, you stand to gain more by Sir
Geoffrey's death than I do."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" she asked, surprised.
</p>

<p>
"You are free to marry Sir Ross."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him, not quite grasping the
purport of his words, but even as he said
them they gave him confidence.  If she was
recalcitrant, he might threaten her.
</p>

<p>
"Except yourself, no one can ever throw
light upon Sir Geoffrey's death.  You must
swear that you will throw none on it."
</p>

<p>
She did not answer, but sat like a statue of
despair, as white as marble and as motionless.
Already they were drawing near to Clapham
Junction; ten or twelve minutes were all
that were left for him to get the oath he must
obtain.
</p>

<p>
"Think," he said swiftly.  "Think what
it might mean if a living soul knew that you
were at that boathouse to-day.  You&mdash;Sir
Geoffrey's wife&mdash;living on money derived
from a man whom you had feloniously
married, engaged to be married again to a
man who is twice a millionaire!  What
would be said?  That you had everything
to gain by the death of Sir Geoffrey Holt,
supposing your identity became known, as
it must be then: that you could hope for
no help or forgiveness from him, and that as
the wife of Sir Ross you would be rich beyond
the dreams of avarice&mdash;and safe.  They would
find there motive enough for the crime, and
would say that your hand fired the shot.
And if you told the truth, and swore I did
it, why should they believe you?  Why
should I, who have lived all my life upon Sir
Geoffrey's bounty, kill the man upon whom
I actually depend for my daily bread?"
</p>

<p>
Lavender stared at him with increasing
horror.  Could he possibly intend to shift
suspicion on to her, or was he only putting into
words what would be the general opinion if
her presence at Fairbridge that afternoon
became known?  Melville read the doubt in
her mind, and, with his fiendish cleverness,
allayed her first uncertainty.  To let that
rankle might be to goad her too far, but he
must appeal to her self-interest too.
</p>

<p>
"If it got to that, of course that would be
the end of me," he said, "for I should have
to confess that the deed was only mine, and
I could not be taken alive.  But think what
you stand to lose: the income you have,
the fortune you may have, your name, your
reputation, possibly your freedom.  You
would be so involved in a scandal of bigamy
and murder that in self-defence you would
have to disappear.  Lavender, it isn't only
for my sake that I'm putting it all like this;
I'm not asking you to do anything.  I'm
only imploring you for both our sakes to do
nothing.  Will you give me your solemn
promise to hold your tongue for ever about
to-day's work?  Will you swear not to say
one word of where we have been, or anything
else, to any living soul?  Will you,
Lavender&mdash;will you?"
</p>

<p>
In sheer despair she retired from the
unequal contest.
</p>

<p>
"I promise," she said.  "I will be silent."
</p>

<p>
Melville could not repress a sigh of relief.
It never occurred to him to doubt her
reliability.  She would keep her promise, he
knew, and he would be safe.  But there was
no opportunity for further converse.  They
were at Vauxhall, and the man who collected
their tickets got into the compartment and
travelled with them to Waterloo.
</p>

<p>
At the terminus Melville put Lavender
into a hansom.
</p>

<p>
"Don't write to me or call," he said.  "I
must go home at once, and I shall probably
have to go down again to Fairbridge.  They
are sure to send for me.  I will write to you
as soon as I can and fix up an appointment."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him in wonder.  He had
courage of its kind, and courage of any kind
appeals to women.
</p>

<p>
"You need not be afraid," she murmured.
"I will keep my promise," and as he told
the cabman where to go, she leaned back
and closed her eyes in utter exhaustion.
</p>

<p>
Left by himself, Melville, too, could have
collapsed; there was a physical reaction that
left all his joints weak, and he shivered with
cold.  But danger was not over yet; much
would depend upon his getting into his rooms
unnoticed.  So he hailed another hansom and
drove to Piccadilly Circus.
</p>

<p>
"What sort of storm have you had here?"
he asked, as he paid the cabman.
</p>

<p>
"Bad, sir; very heavy about four o'clock."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well," Melville said, "it's good for
your business, I daresay."
</p>

<p>
He walked round the corner into Jermyn
Street erect and steady, although he felt so
excited.  How would things work out?  The
street was almost empty, for London was
dressing for dinner, and the commissionaire
was not standing by the front door of the
chambers.  A swift glance into the office
showed Melville that that was empty too, and
rapidly he walked along the thickly-carpeted
passage.  Opposite the lift he paused to
scan the names upon the letters stuck in the
letter rack, and his heart leaped as he caught
sight of the orange envelope of a telegram
addressed to himself.  So it had come!  He
put out his hand involuntarily to take it,
but checked the impulse and silently ran up
the staircase and gained his rooms.  Once
there he tore off all his clothes and hung
them in a wardrobe, which he locked.  He
changed his linen, dried and brushed his hair,
and then, putting on a pair of flannel trousers
and a smoking jacket, rang the bell and lay
down on the sofa, a cigarette in his mouth, a
paper in his hand.
</p>

<p>
After an interval the bell was answered
by the manager.
</p>

<p>
"Where's Jervis to-day, then?" Melville
asked pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
"Went off duty, sir, at twelve.  He'll be
back at eight.  Can I do anything for you?"
</p>

<p>
"I wanted some tea," said Melville.  "I'm
ashamed to say I've been asleep."
</p>

<p>
"I'll bring it to you," the manager said.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," Melville answered.  "You
might see if there are any letters for me,"
and he rose and stretched himself.
</p>

<p>
Tea arrived, and on the tray there lay a
couple of letters and the telegram.  Melville
tore it open, and an exclamation of surprise
and horror broke from him.
</p>

<p>
"When did this come?" he asked.  "Half
an hour ago!  Oh, why wasn't it brought up
to me at once?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm very sorry," the manager said, "but
I really didn't know you were in."
</p>

<p>
"I've been in all the afternoon," said
Melville.  "Who would go out in such a
storm if they could help it?  But, in any
case, I think someone should bring up
telegrams to see if I am at home.  It's
awful&mdash;awful!"
</p>

<p>
"Bad news, sir?" asked the manager.
</p>

<p>
"Awful," said Melville again.  "Sir
Geoffrey Holt is dead.  I must go down at
once."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br><br>
AN UNEXPECTED WILL.
</h3>

<p>
That Sir Geoffrey's violent end should have
an almost paralysing effect upon the household
that loved him so much was, of course,
only to be expected, but it is impossible to
tell beforehand how great grief will manifest
itself in different people.  Thus Ralph, who
enjoyed a reputation of being bright and
frank and open-hearted beyond the common,
became morose and even sullen, nursing his
wrath against the unknown murderer and
allowing the iron to enter into his soul.
Melville, on the contrary, hitherto self-centred
and indifferent to the happiness of others,
seemed to be softened by the tragedy, and
in many little ways displayed an eagerness
to comfort the rest and a regard for their
sorrow that was very winning.  The inquest
which was held two days after the outrage
was ineffective: a verdict of wilful murder
was returned against some person unknown,
and the case was recommended by the
coroner to the attention of the police.  So
far they preserved a sphinx-like silence, and
although conjecture was rife in the
neighbourhood it received no assistance or
corroboration from the detectives engaged.
</p>

<p>
The evidence given at the inquest was
little more than formal; the doctor's testimony
was brevity itself, Ralph's was concise
to the point of curtness, and the police
inspector had no suggestions to offer; the
facts were self-evident, and of the only
details that seemed to promise any interest,
namely, the bloodstains upon Ralph's jacket
and in the water in the basin, his explanation
was so obviously simple that comment was
superfluous.  Yet upon the people in the
court Ralph's manner had an effect not
wholly favourable.  He appeared to resent
their natural curiosity, was brusque, and
even in bowing to the coroner, when that
functionary gave expression to the sympathy
felt by his court for Sir Geoffrey's relatives,
did not err upon the side of graciousness.
But if Ralph thus failed to maintain the
family traditions of courtesy, Melville atoned
for it.  He was merely asked whether he
could throw any light upon the crime by
suggesting any motive which might have
prompted it, and this, it is needless to say,
he could not do.  But his quiet dignity in
this moment of sorrow and his air of engaging
candour won all hearts, and he quitted the
scene in full possession of the sympathy of
the audience.
</p>

<p>
There followed two most miserable days,
during which Ralph smoked in solitude upon
his houseboat, and Melville, for the most
part, idled at The Grange.  Music fits every
mood, and there was no disrespect to the
uncle by the nephew turning to his Amati
for comfort in this dark hour, and so he
played&mdash;played as if inspired by Saint Cecilia&mdash;and
stole a little further into Gwendolen's
heart.
</p>

<p>
It was with a sense of genuine relief that
the two brothers returned to the Manor House
after the funeral.  There was a certain
restraint between them and an odd embarrassment
as to their mutual attitude in the small
matters of daily life; thus Sir Geoffrey's
chair at the head of the table was left empty
by consent, but it stood as a constant reminder
that for one of them it symbolised possession,
and now that its late tenant was laid to rest
with his fathers, the question as to which
of the two should sit in it by right was about
to be decided.
</p>

<p>
With the closing of the inquest Melville's
first fears of detection were allayed, and his
mind was engaged almost exclusively with
the problem of his future.  He took it for
granted that his uncle had died intestate,
and the only complication he could foresee
in the division of the estate was brought
about by the existence of Lavender, of which
he believed he was the only person who knew.
Mr. Tracy might know, and if he did, Melville
supposed that half the estate would be held,
pending Lady Holt's instructions, and that
the other half would be divided between his
brother and himself without undue delay.
What action he should take with regard to
Lavender it was too early to decide, but in a
vague way he was beginning to incline to the
policy of persuading her never to come forward,
which he was confident he could do, and,
by-and-bye, her share, too, might be obtainable
for himself, or, at any rate, half of it.
</p>

<p>
The brothers were standing in the hall,
both feeling rather aimless and self-conscious,
when Martin joined them.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Tracy mentioned that he had to
return to London soon after the funeral, so
I have taken some luncheon into the library.
I thought, perhaps, you would have business
to do before he left."
</p>

<p>
The butler directed his remarks
diplomatically between the two young men.  He
assumed that the Manor House would be
left to Ralph, as being the elder, but he did
not wish to make any invidious distinctions
between them at present.  They looked at
each other and went into the library, where
they found Mr. Tracy contemplating a
substantial pie as if wondering what description
of animal food it might contain.  The old
lawyer looked up at them with a smile, and
settled all difficulties of precedence by sitting
down in the nearest chair, which happened
to be at the head of the table.  He knew the
utility of a meal as a preparation for an
unpleasant discussion, and although as Sir
Geoffrey's solicitor he was only the
mouthpiece by which the dead man's disposition
of his property was to be communicated, he
felt uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not ashamed to say that I am
particularly hungry," he remarked.  "With
your permission, I will discuss this pie before
discussing business," and he proceeded to
make an excellent luncheon, talking all the
while of everything except that which was
uppermost in all their minds.
</p>

<p>
But, luncheon disposed of, his manner changed.
</p>

<p>
"I have had two copies of Sir Geoffrey's
will prepared," he said, "and perhaps you
would like to look at them while I read the
original.  It is not a long document, but
the technical phraseology may, perhaps, seem
confusing to the lay mind."
</p>

<p>
He turned to a table in the window, where
he had placed a bag containing his papers,
and so did not observe the slight start of
surprise which Melville could not repress.  So
there was a will after all!  Was fortune about
to play him a scurvy trick after he had dared
so much?  He lighted a cigarette and sat
down in a chair where the light would not
fall upon his face.
</p>

<p>
"In its main features," continued
Mr. Tracy, who seemed to be taking an
unconscionable time fumbling in his bag, "the
will, as I have said, is sufficiently simple, but
it contains at least one element of surprise.
I will read it without further comment, and
you can follow from the copies," and, giving
a type-written copy of the will to Ralph and
another to Melville, he read the original
clearly and distinctly.
</p>

<p>
Beginning with legacies to the servants,
ranging from a year's wages to the youngest
maid to life provision for Martin Somers, the
will ordained that a charge should be made
upon the estate sufficient to give an annuity
of four hundred pounds a year to the testator's
widow, Dame Lavinia Holt, to be paid
quarterly to her in person, on application at
Mr. Tracy's office, the first instalment to be
paid upon her first making such personal
application, and not necessarily to accrue
from the date of her husband's death;
subject only to these legacies and this one
charge, everything real and personal was
bequeathed to "my dear nephew, Ralph
Ashley," for his uncontrolled use and
enjoyment.  Of Melville's name no mention
whatever was made.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tracy folded up the document and
waited.  The silence grew painful.  Ralph
did not know what to say, and Melville could
not trust himself to speak.  He was white
with mortification and rage, and could have
cursed himself for having with his own hand
destroyed his last chance for the future.  He
cleared his throat and tried to speak, but
the words would not come.  Ralph looked
enquiringly at the solicitor.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose there can be no mistake," he
said; "but this lady&mdash;who is she?  I have
never heard until this minute that my uncle
ever married."
</p>

<p>
"I can throw no light upon the mystery,"
Mr. Tracy said.  "Sir Geoffrey was not the
man to give confidences.  He drafted this
will himself, less than a month ago, and all I
have done is to engross it and procure his
signature.  I should like to say that I
ventured to ask certain questions and even make
certain suggestions, but they were received
with unmistakable disapproval, and, of
course, I could not pursue the matter."
</p>

<p>
"It is iniquitous," said Melville hoarsely.
He rose abruptly from his chair and faced
his brother.  "This is your work, you
scoundrel!  For years you have left nothing
undone to estrange Sir Geoffrey from me.
You have schemed and plotted for this, and
at the last minute, curse you, you have
succeeded.  Well, you may be hugging
yourself now, but I swear you will live to be
sorry."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tracy tried to pacify him, but in his
heart he was not a little sorry for him.  It
must be a terrible shock to find himself thus
ignored by the uncle from whom, for all the
lawyer knew to the contrary, he had every
right to expect munificent provision.  And
the lawyer spoke the truth when he said he
had ventured to plead Melville's cause with
Sir Geoffrey, although he reduced to the
lowest possible terms the substance of the
old man's answer to his pleading; yet even
at that interview, when Sir Geoffrey might
reasonably have been expected to confide
entirely in the lawyer engaged to give legal
effect to his last testament, he had refrained;
his native pride forbade him to dilate upon
his story, and kindly, but quite firmly, he
declared his intention not to swerve from
the course which he had chosen.  Now that
the thing was done, however, Mr. Tracy
preferred that the possible quarrel between
the two young men should be deferred until
after his own departure, so he reverted to
the matter immediately in hand.
</p>

<p>
"Subject to your approval," he said,
addressing Ralph, whom alone it was now
necessary to consult, "I will take steps to
ascertain Lady Holt's address.  Sir Geoffrey
told me he knew she was alive, but did not
know where she was to be found.  I rather
inferred that she was in London, and in poor
circumstances."
</p>

<p>
"Act as you think right," said Ralph.
He was so surprised by the revelation that
he was impatient to learn the whole story.
"Make all possible enquiries, and if they
fail, why not advertise a reward for
information about her?  Why should Sir Geoffrey's
wife be in poor circumstances at all?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps she was misrepresented to her
husband," Melville said bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I will see about it," said Mr. Tracy,
"and let you know the result.  Now I must
really hurry away.  I ventured to ask the
butler to order a conveyance to take me up
to the station.  Good-bye, Mr. Melville.  I
quite understand your very natural
disappointment, and I do not hesitate to say I
am sorry about it.  If I can be of any service
to you at any time do not hesitate to
command me."
</p>

<p>
Ralph walked to the door with Mr. Tracy.
</p>

<p>
"I'm all at sixes and sevens for the
minute," he said, "but I should like to see
you again soon.  Uncle Geoffrey may have
left Melville nothing, but he has made no
conditions in leaving me so much.  You
can, doubtless, advise me what would be the
best thing to do about my brother."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be particularly glad to do so,"
the old lawyer replied heartily.  "Give me
time to confirm any appointment, as I am
very busy just now, but, within reason, I can
come here or see you in the Fields at any
time."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I'm in for a quarrel with
Melville," Ralph continued seriously, "so I
should just like to add this.  He's not likely
to agree to accept anything from me, but if
he turns up later on to consult you, can't you
let him have a hundred or so without saying
too precisely where it comes from?  You
can make it right with me afterwards."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I can," said Mr. Tracy.  "Very
delicate of you, I'm sure.  I shall be delighted
to take part in so amiable a conspiracy," and,
shaking the new master of the Manor House
warmly by the hand, he got into the carriage
and drove away.
</p>

<p>
Ralph watched the carriage disappear, and
turned back into the house with a sigh.
How was he to deal with his brother in this
moment of humiliation, which Melville would
with difficulty be persuaded was not due to
him?  Although they were brothers and so
nearly of an age, the difference in their
temperaments was such that Ralph felt
certain beforehand that he could not hope
to appeal successfully to the better part of
Melville's character, which surely must exist.
If Sir Geoffrey, with all the authority of age
and wealth, could not control his younger
nephew, how could Ralph hope to succeed?
He lingered in the hall, reluctant to open
what would be a painful interview, and as he
looked at the familiar things, with their
evidence of wealth and cultured taste, and
realised that they were all his, he became
conscious for the first time of the duties and
responsibilities which he had inherited with
his rights and privileges.  There was no
mental reservation in the inarticulate
expression of regret at his uncle's death that
escaped him.  Even if it had come in the
ordinary course of nature, he would fain
have postponed the day, and lived content
and happy with the dear old man, as he had
done for so many years; but for the end to
come so tragically, so treacherously, increased
the bitterness a thousandfold, and Ralph's
first emotion as he looked upon his goodly
heritage was one of unmitigated grief at
having thus entered upon his own.
</p>

<p>
But after a little while he raised his head
with a new expression of peace and high
purpose on his face.  He would strive to be
as good a master of the fine old Manor as
Sir Geoffrey had ever been, and the moment
to begin his duties had arrived.  He must
offer the hand of brotherhood to Melville,
and enlist his help in tracking their uncle's
murderer to his doom.  More hopefully he
went slowly from the hall to join his brother
in the library; but as he opened the door a
feeling of chill disappointment stole over
him, for Melville, too, had shirked the
interview and the room was empty.  As Ralph
turned to the window with a sigh he saw
his brother, looking tall and slight in his
sombre mourning, moving slowly over the
sunlit turf and making evidently in the
direction of The Grange.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br><br>
AN ARREST.
</h3>

<p>
It was the fact that Melville shirked a
conversation with his brother immediately after
the reading of the will; the mental strain
had been so great that he could not be sure
of his temper or judgment, and that being
so, common prudence dictated a delay which
would enable him to consider the new situation
in all its bearings before risking a final
rupture with the new lord of the Manor.
He sought a temporary refuge at The Grange,
where he knew he would receive commiseration
upon his terrible disappointment, and
where he might derive some sardonic satisfaction
from the knowledge that his presence
by Gwendolen's side would involve Ralph's
absence from the same desirable spot.
Mrs. Austen was quite frank in her condemnation
of Sir Geoffrey's action.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever Melville may or may not have
done, it is unfair to allow a young fellow
to grow up without any profession or occupation,
in the belief that he will inherit a
considerable fortune, and then to ignore his
existence in this way."
</p>

<p>
Gwendolen agreed with the abstract
proposition, but could not believe that Sir
Geoffrey would have taken such drastic
measures without good reason; she hinted
as much, but her mother would have none
of it.
</p>

<p>
"I dare say Sir Geoffrey had plenty to
put up with from Melville," she said, "but
that is the penalty of having children,
whether they are your own or adopted by
you.  What makes this will so inexplicable
is that it was made such a little while ago,
for just lately Melville seemed to be on better
terms with his uncle than he had been for
years.  I'm sure there is some mischief-maker
at the bottom of it all, and if it had
not been for this terrible murder Sir Geoffrey
would have got at the rights of the story,
whatever it was, and made a new will."
</p>

<p>
"Melville is fortunate in having such a
brother as Ralph," said Gwendolen; "it
isn't as if the money were left to strangers.
I don't suppose there will be any difference
really."
</p>

<p>
"What nonsense!" said Mrs. Austen
testily.  "Ralph is a very charming young
man, and I'm delighted you're going to be
his wife, but I have a very warm place in
my heart for Melville, and I think it's quite
possible he has been misjudged; and your
most excellent Ralph goes about with the
cheerful expression of a professional mute
whenever Melville comes down.  Lately, for
instance, since Melville has been here so
frequently we haven't seen half so much
of Ralph."
</p>

<p>
Gwendolen sighed.  She had not failed to
observe the fact, but she could throw no
light upon the reason of it.  Ralph resembled
Sir Geoffrey in being very taciturn where his
private feelings were concerned; she remembered
the day when Sir Geoffrey said he had
a bone to pick with Ralph.  The discussion
ended satisfactorily, but she connected the
slight trouble in some way with Melville,
who, as she afterwards learned, had seen his
uncle the previous night, and Ralph's
championship of his brother's cause had been
discontinued from that time; since then,
indeed, he never talked about him.  It was
all very puzzling and sad.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, Melville forsook the
neighbourhood.  He accepted Mrs. Austen's
hospitality for a couple of nights, and then,
frankly confessing that the proximity of the
Manor House with its associations was
intolerable to him in his present frame of mind,
returned to London, outwardly calm enough,
but inwardly consumed by a raging fire of
evil passions.  As he paced his chambers,
secure from prying eyes, hate and fear,
chagrin and lust for revenge swept across his
pallid face, and sometimes, as he caught
sight of his reflection in the mirror, he thought
the whole world must be able to read his
secret in the careworn lines, which in reality
it ascribed to laudable grief and natural
disappointment.  It is a kind-hearted place,
this same world of ours, provided its patience
and generosity are not unduly taxed, and
just now it laid itself out to make things
easier for Melville.  He accepted the proffered
sympathy gratefully, and won a new sort of
popularity by his quiet pluck and his gentle
air of resignation.  Old people thought he
was chastened by his trouble; young ones
thought he was to be pitied; and Melville
made the most of this occasion to make new
friends among the children of this world.
</p>

<p>
But he did not forget his vow that Ralph
should live to be sorry for having contributed,
however indirectly, to his disinheritance, and
wherever he went he sowed scandal with
both hands.  It is an invisible seed, of which
the fruit is more deadly than the upas tree,
and in sowing it as he did it is possible that
Melville himself had no idea of what the
harvest would be.  Society knew little of
Sir Geoffrey, who lived a comparatively
retired life in his fine old Surrey home, but
the mystery attaching to the unknown Lady
Holt tickled its palate, and the murder of a
man who was one of its order was not lightly
to be forgotten.  Thus at many a dinner
party, where the subject was delicately
broached, and at many a little luncheon in
the clubs, where the conversation veered
upon the question of undetected criminals,
remarks were made&mdash;no one could afterwards
precisely say by whom&mdash;which went to
direct the general suspicion towards one
point.
</p>

<p>
"What is the good of all this parrot-talk
about motives," he said on one occasion.
"When once you set to work imputing
motives you need never stop.  Anybody can
tell you that half the murders in the world
are due to drink or jealousy.  Neither comes
into this case.  And England isn't like Sicily
or Corsica, where vendetta is an institution.
Sir Geoffrey could not have had an enemy
in the world, so you may rule out revenge
as well."
</p>

<p>
"How about the lady?" someone suggested,
but Melville disposed of the idea.
</p>

<p>
"She can't have got her knife into him,
or she would not have lain so low all these
years.  Besides, it looks as if Sir Geoffrey
believed her to be dead, for he made some
funny arrangements about her annuity.
Anyhow, all that is pretty certain to come to
light, for I believe there is a big reward
offered to anyone who will produce her.  No;
I don't see much use in fooling after motives."
</p>

<p>
That was as far as he allowed himself to
go then, but elsewhere, and to another
audience, he took a different line and seemed
interested in hearing the general opinion on
this same subject of motives.  He sat silent
until the end of the conversation, when he
appeared disinclined to endorse the verdict
of the rest.
</p>

<p>
"It's too jolly dangerous," he said gravely,
"to go about suggesting people who might
commit a crime, and then inventing reasons
why they should do it.  It's very easy to
vary the amusement, until you begin to
believe you have found the motive and the
man by a process of exhaustion.  Why, Sir
Geoffrey once told me he had made no will;
is there sufficient motive there for me to
kill him so that I might benefit under an
intestacy?  On the other hand, my brother
knew he had made one, though I don't suppose
he knew its tenour.  Is there sufficient motive
there for him to kill the old man on the
chance of coming in?  The thing is absurd
on the face of it.  We were both dependent
on him, and I venture to say that no two
fellows were ever fonder of their father than
we were of our uncle."
</p>

<p>
It was not often he was as precise as that.
For the most part he contented himself
with the vaguest remarks, all harmless
individually, but totalling up to an incredible
strength when put together by skilful brains;
and skilful brains were doing it, brains owned
by men who, in spite of all detractors, are
marvellously shrewd, and who do not often
have to confess themselves beaten in the end,
although they may sometimes take a long
time upon the journey, and even make errors
by the way.  Whose business it was to
gather these rumours and carry them to the
detectives engaged upon the case, it matters
not to enquire; popular opinion is no
evidence, but it is often useful as indicating
where evidence may be found, and, Melville's
expressed opinion notwithstanding, all
lawyers attach importance to motive in arguing
for or against the criminality of individuals.
At any rate, they agreed in the advisability
of making an arrest upon suspicion, and
their selection of the individual was partly
influenced by some of these random and
irresponsible remarks.
</p>

<p>
The Manor House was looking its best in
the mellow light of an ideal summer evening.
It had been one of those days when it is
impossible not to feel delight in life, and
Ralph awoke to full consciousness of the
fact that he had youth and love and wealth
to comfort himself withal.  He spent the
morning at The Grange, and after luncheon
punted Gwendolen up the river, arranging
for Mrs. Austen to join them at the Manor
House.  There was no flaw in his happiness
that day, and, perhaps because of the violent
contrast between its morning and its night,
it always stood out afterwards with particular
distinctness in his memory.  Returning from
Longbridge, he put on his evening clothes
and went to The Grange to fetch Gwendolen
and her mother; they strolled leisurely down
to the Manor House and lingered over dinner,
discussing idly many little plans for alterations
to be made in the old place for the fuller
satisfaction of its new mistress.
</p>

<p>
Martin hovered about them, anticipating
their every want, and when at last they left
the dining-room they resumed the discontinued
custom, and decided to have their
coffee brought to them on the houseboat.
It seemed to mark the closing of a tragedy
and the resumption of the pleasant routine
of their country life.
</p>

<p>
And as on that evening&mdash;which now seemed
so long ago&mdash;when the last of the guests,
summoned to congratulate them on their
betrothal, had departed, and Sir Geoffrey
and Mrs. Austen joined Ralph and Gwendolen,
so now the sound of music was borne to them
from other houseboats on the river, so now
a stray punt was poled swiftly down the
stream, and the swans floated out from their
nooks under the willows and rocked gracefully
in its wake.  Everything goes on just the
same, although the best and greatest of us
die.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Austen was dozing comfortably in
her chair, and Ralph sat close to Gwendolen,
smoking in perfect content.  Both were seeing
visions of the future, a future of unbroken
peace and happiness spent in each other's
company, and the interruption of their waking
dream by the sound of footsteps coming on
board was not unwelcome, as it only suggested
another little touch in the picture of
material prosperity of which they themselves
furnished the human interest.
</p>

<p>
Martin deposited his tray in the kitchen in
the tender, and came up to Ralph.
</p>

<p>
"May I speak to you for a moment, sir?"
he said almost in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
Ralph looked up surprised.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Martin?  Anything the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"I should like to speak to you alone, sir,
if I may."
</p>

<p>
Martin followed him to the top of the
ladder.
</p>

<p>
"A gentleman has come&mdash;in connection
with the murder," he said, an odd look of
embarrassment upon his face, "and he says
he must see you at once; he won't be denied."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I must see him at once," said
Ralph.  "Why should he be denied?"
</p>

<p>
The look on Martin's face was pitiful.
</p>

<p>
"I can't tell you what I mean, Mr. Ralph,"
he said, "but I'm sure there is some hideous
mistake.  I think&mdash;I think he thinks you
know something about it."
</p>

<p>
Ralph stared at the old servant in blank
astonishment, utterly failing to comprehend
his meaning.
</p>

<p>
"Where is the gentleman?" he said, but
the question was answered for Martin.  A
tall figure was standing at the foot of the
stairway, and bowed to Ralph as he reached
the bottom step.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ralph Ashley?"
</p>

<p>
"At your service," Ralph answered
pleasantly.  "I understand you want to see me
about this murder.  Have you discovered
anything?"
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry you have company, Mr. Ashley,"
the officer said in a quiet tone, so
that his words might not be overheard
upstairs.  "I am a detective, and I hold a
warrant for your arrest in connection with
the murder of Sir Geoffrey Holt."
</p>

<p>
"My arrest?" cried Ralph.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," the officer replied.  "You
understand, of course, that I am only acting
in accordance with my instructions, and it is
my duty to remind you that anything you
say will be available as evidence."
</p>

<p>
Ralph's first impulse was to laugh, but
the grotesque horror of the situation was
too much for him.  He drew himself up
with dignity.
</p>

<p>
"I will come with you at once," he said.
"Excuse me for a moment.  I must tell my
guests that I am compelled to bid them
good-night."
</p>

<p>
The detective hesitated, and Ralph flushed
as he understood.
</p>

<p>
"By all means come upstairs," he said,
with cold hauteur.  "You will, doubtless,
excuse me if I refrain from introducing you
to the lady who is going to do me the honour
of becoming my wife."  He went upstairs
again, but his native instincts of a gentleman
reasserting themselves in the brief interval,
he turned to the detective as they gained
the roof.  "I beg your pardon for saying
that," he said, with wonderfully winning
courtesy; "perhaps you will oblige me by
allowing me to present you to Miss Austen.
Your name is&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Anstruther," the man answered.
</p>

<p>
Ralph went up to Gwendolen.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to cause you a minute's distress
or anxiety, darling," he said, "but this
gentleman, Mr. Anstruther, requires my
attendance in the matter of Uncle Geoffrey's
death."
</p>

<p>
Gwendolen started up.
</p>

<p>
"Requires&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
Ralph stroked her hand.
</p>

<p>
"I would rather you knew it from me,
since you must know it.  Mr. Anstruther is
instructed to detain me on suspicion of being
somehow implicated."  He looked imploringly
at the detective, who came gallantly to
his rescue.
</p>

<p>
"Merely on suspicion, Miss Austen," he
said, in a full rich voice that conveyed
confidence somehow.  "I am more sorry than
I can say that it falls to me to come on
such an errand, but I fancy you would be
the last to wish me not to do my duty."
</p>

<p>
Ralph kissed Gwendolen, who clung to him.
</p>

<p>
"We must show a brave front, Gwen," he
said.  "It's horrible to think that anybody
can suspect me of having had a hand in the
dear old man's death, but since somebody
does, the only thing now is to clear myself
before the world."  He turned to Mrs. Austen.
"If I should happen to be unable to come
home to-morrow, I wonder if you would mind
taking up your quarters at the Manor House?
I should like to think that you and Gwen
were there, and it might be well if someone
was available to help Mr. Tracy if necessary."
</p>

<p>
"Of course we will if you wish it,"
Mrs. Austen said.  She was boiling over with
indignation at the outrage, but controlled
herself admirably, partly for her daughter's
sake and partly from a natural pride which
forbade her to betray emotion.  Indeed,
they were all wonderfully self-possessed.
</p>

<p>
"A thousand thanks," Ralph said gratefully.
"Martin will see you home and will
come on to get me anything I may want.
Good-night, Mrs. Austen.  Good-night, my
darling."
</p>

<p>
He pressed his lips passionately upon her
mouth, and she returned him kiss for kiss.
Then, with head erect and a proud look on
his frank and boyish face, he led the way
downstairs, followed by the detective; while,
on the houseboat, Gwendolen, clasping her
mother's hand, strained longing eyes upon
his figure until it was lost to sight amid the
shadows of the trees.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br><br>
A FAITHFUL SERVANT.
</h3>

<p>
For Ralph, in the period of forced inactivity
that followed, existence became a nightmare;
the charge against him being one of murder,
bail was not granted, and his innocence,
instead of making his incarceration tolerable,
added to its horror.  He felt stifled, and raged
at being shut up within the four walls of a
cell in this glorious summer weather, when,
but for the crass imbecility of some
over-zealous detective, he might have been
luxuriating in the sunshine with Gwendolen on the
Thames.  By degrees, too, a morbid nervousness
took possession of him.  When brought
before the magistrates he was astounded at
the weight of evidence that seemed to have
been piled up against him in the interval;
what a clever counsel for the Crown might
make of it all he was afraid to think, and
talking about it to Mr. Tracy afterwards,
frankly admitted that he was beginning to
feel uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
"If I'm committed for trial," he said,
when, instead of being discharged as he
expected, he was remanded for a week, "I
shall feel that I am half way to the gallows.
These lawyers are the very devil, and I don't
believe a saint would emerge from
cross-examination with a rag of character left."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tracy reassured him then, and Gwendolen
cheered him up by her loving sympathy.
</p>

<p>
"Mother and I have seen Melville," she
said, "and we will not leave a single thing
undone to put an end to this horrible blunder
with the enquiry before the magistrates.  I
can't believe that it will be possible to twist
facts into evidence enough to justify your
committal.  It will be all right next time,
and I shall insist upon being married to you
by special licence directly you are discharged,
as a sort of vote of confidence in you."
</p>

<p>
She would not allow him to guess how
anxious she was, and spared him all
knowledge of how strongly the tide of public
opinion was running against him; but at the
Manor House, when alone with her mother,
she broke out into a storm of indignation
against her neighbours.
</p>

<p>
"It shakes one's faith in human nature,"
she said passionately, "that anyone can be
found to believe such a preposterous charge.
Of course Ralph knew he would be Sir
Geoffrey's heir, and to suggest that he would
commit murder to antedate his possession
by a few years is absurd.  And then all this
haggling about minutes!  Of course any
man would change his clothes before bothering
to get himself a whiskey and soda.  If there
hadn't been such an awful storm, Ralph
would not have discovered the murder at all;
he would have gone straight up to The Grange
without looking into Sir Geoffrey's room."
</p>

<p>
For it was upon the time spent by Ralph
in the boathouse that the police were at
present chiefly relying to substantiate the
charge against him; they showed that the
moment suggested by the doctor as that
when the fatal shot took effect must have
synchronised with Ralph's arrival in the
boathouse, and there was absolutely no
evidence to show that anyone else had been
there at all.  Mr. Tracy's suggestion that
the murderer would scarcely be so foolish as
to leave his blood-stained garments lying on
the floor was heard politely, but not accepted
as sufficient to warrant a discharge, and the
request of the police for a remand, pending
further investigation, was acceded to without
dissent.  So for another week they were
obliged to possess their souls in patience.
</p>

<p>
But while upon Gwendolen Ralph's arrest
had only the effect of increasing her love
and developing her mental activity on his
behalf, upon Lavender Sinclair its effect
was very different.
</p>

<p>
When she reached home, after parting
from Melville at Waterloo on the evening of
the murder, she broke down physically.
During the row from Fairbridge to
St. Martin's Lock she contracted a bad chill,
which compelled her to keep her bed.  This,
indeed, she was only too glad to do.  In her
darkened room she lay with her throbbing
head buried in the pillows, as if to exclude
from her sight the daylight that only served
to remind her of the work going on in the
world; it would be someone's work to trace
the man who fired the shot, of which the
sound still rang in her ears, and when he
was found&mdash;&mdash;.  She fought against her illness,
which was real enough.  If she became
delirious she might talk, and part of her
penance for the future would be the guard
that she must ever keep upon her tongue.
She almost feared to sleep, lest an only
partially unconscious brain should prompt
her to babble of that which she had seen.
Gently, but firmly, she insisted upon being
left alone, and in her solitude she struggled
to be well.
</p>

<p>
At first she kept aloof from all news of the
world outside; would see no papers, and
checked Lucille's inclination to chatter, but
soon this mood was replaced by one of
feverish desire to know what had happened
at Fairbridge; at any rate, she must not be
taken unawares, and every day's delay was
a day's respite.  In one of the weekly papers
she read an account of the tragedy and of the
inquest that followed, and derived some
vague assurance from the frank admission
of the police that they were absolutely without
a clue.
</p>

<p>
This relaxed the tension of her nerves,
and when the next morning dawned, she
felt less ill and better able to resume her
ordinary life.  She drew up the blinds and
threw open the window; presently she would
go for a drive and let rapid motion through
the fresh air banish the last traces of the
headache that had tortured her since&mdash;then.
If only she dared she would call at Jermyn
Street, but her promise not to write to or
call on Melville must be kept.  If she had
kept her former promise to remain in the boat
how much agony she would have escaped!
</p>

<p>
She turned away from the window and
looked round her room; she had means to
gratify all reasonable desires, and she was
cat-like in her fondness for warmth and soft
rugs and cushions.  All down one wall of her
bedroom was a broad settee spread thickly
with down pillows and covered with magnificent
opossum rugs.  Curtains, draped tent
fashion from the ceiling, screened this divan
from every draught, and Moorish lanterns,
filled with scented oil, illumined it by night.
An inlaid Syrian table stood near at hand,
and there was a suggestion of Oriental luxury
about the place that seemed to bar anything
not conducive to repose.  From a hanging
wardrobe Lavender took a comfortable peignoir,
a French creation of billowy chiffon and
lace and ribbons, and leaving the windows
open, stretched herself upon the divan and
pulled up the rugs breast high; and while
she lay there waiting for her maid to come to
her, her thoughts wandered to what she
stood to lose if any change occurred in her
life other than the one she might voluntarily
make by marrying Sir Ross Buchanan.
</p>

<p>
Except Melville, no one knew she had
ever been Sir Geoffrey's wife, and she might
rely upon his respecting her wish for the
secret to be preserved now that she was in
possession of this terrible secret of his.  Sir
Geoffrey had held his peace about the past
in which she had figured, and it might be
buried with him in his grave; the fear of
prosecution for her bigamous marriage with
Mr. Sinclair, which Melville had conjured up
so vividly before her, was removed as well,
and she could continue her indolent existence
as his widow at The Vale, or burst forth into a
period of splendour as the wife of the Scotch
millionaire.  No one knew of the picnic up
the river, and the procrastination, in which
she had acquiesced through terror and physical
illness, had proved the safest and wisest policy
after all.  Of such an offence as being an
accessory after the fact in any crime,
Lavender, in her rather uneducated state, had no
idea; if she had ever heard the phrase, it
conveyed no meaning to her.  She would
acquiesce in a policy of absolute silence&mdash;forget
her individuality as Lady Holt, and
resume her ordinary life as the widow of
the estimable Mr. Sinclair, who had provided
for her maintenance on a scale that coincided
so accurately with her desires.
</p>

<p>
Lucille tapped gently at the door and
opened it softly in case her mistress should
be still asleep, but when she saw the open
window and the vacant bed she came in
briskly, pleased to know that Lavender
must be better.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad," she said with a smile,
"you are better?"
</p>

<p>
"Much better," said Lavender; "well,
and more than ready for some breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"That is good," the maid replied, and
disappeared to return with an inviting tray,
which she placed on the table by Lavender's
side; and while Lavender, reclining on the
divan, enjoyed her breakfast thoroughly,
Lucille busied herself about the room and
chatted pleasantly of trifles.
</p>

<p>
Presently Lucille removed the tray, and,
sitting on a low chair by Lavender's side,
began to brush out her mistress's hair,
while Lavender leant on one arm with her
face turned towards the wall.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't like to mention it to you while
you were so ill," Lucille remarked, "but have
you heard the sad news about Mr. Ashley's
uncle?  Shot in his own summer house!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Lavender replied; "I read about
it yesterday."  She spoke steadily; she had
better get accustomed to hearing the crime
talked about, but still she was glad her face
was averted.
</p>

<p>
"There's some more about it in the papers
to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Is there?" said Lavender sharply.
"Have they found out who did it?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," said Lucille; "there doesn't
seem to be any clue at all."
</p>

<p>
Lavender drew a deep sigh of relief; she
could not be sufficiently grateful for the
extraordinary presence of mind which
Melville had displayed throughout that awful
journey from Fairbridge.  If he had not seen
the handkerchief which she dropped by the
ha-ha they might both be under arrest
already.  But other thoughts were passing
through Lucille's mind.
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing about the murderer,"
she said, "but there is an advertisement
saying that if Lady Holt will apply to some
solicitors she will hear of something to her
advantage.  Did I pull your hair?"
</p>

<p>
For Lavender started perceptibly.
</p>

<p>
"Where is the advertisement?  I should
like to see it."
</p>

<p>
"I thought it would interest you," Lucille
replied, "for the first time Mr. Ashley called
here you told me he might ask for Lady Holt,
and that if he did I was to come and let you
know.  Is Lady Holt a friend of yours?"
</p>

<p>
"Let me see the advertisement," said
Lavender again, and Lucille went to fetch
the morning paper.  While she was gone,
Lavender considered as rapidly as possible
what she had better do.  For ten years
Lucille had been with her, a companion
rather than a servant, the trusted and
trustworthy recipient of all her confidences; and
Lavender, on her part, had played the friend
rather than the mistress to this otherwise
friendless woman, had made her life bright
and happy, and reaped the reward of being
served with fidelity and devotion.  Never
once had Lucille presumed upon her relations
with her employer, and in believing that she
placed her mistress's interests above her own
Lavender judged rightly.  Lucille returned and
gave the newspaper to Lavender, who read
the paragraph with trembling eagerness; she
must give some explanation to Lucille, and
the true explanation was also the politic
one to give.  She turned round and looked
the other woman in the eyes.
</p>

<p>
"It is for me, Lucille," she said in a low
voice.  "I was once Sir Geoffrey Holt's wife."
</p>

<p>
Lucille gasped.
</p>

<p>
"That is your husband that's been
murdered?  Oh, you poor dear!  What an awful
thing!"  But her sympathy was not
commensurate with her curiosity.  "And you
divorced him, I suppose, and he repented and
left you some of his money, and now they
want to know where you are so that they
can hand it over to you.  That's the
something to your advantage, I suppose.  Will
you go and see about it to-day?"
</p>

<p>
The rapidity with which Lucille invented
an entire story to fit in with her views of
probabilities bewildered Lavender.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," she said; "that isn't it at all.
They must never know where I am.  They
must think I am dead, as I always thought
he was when I&mdash;married again."
</p>

<p>
A glimmer of comprehension dawned in
Lucille's face.
</p>

<p>
"You thought him dead when you married
Mr. Sinclair, and he wasn't?"
</p>

<p>
Lavender nodded assent.
</p>

<p>
"I ran away from him and heard nothing
of him, and thought he must be dead or he
would have found me out and compelled me
to go back to him again.  And after seven
years I thought I was free to marry again,
and I married Mr. Sinclair.  It was only the
other day I learned that I was not free and
that my marriage with Mr. Sinclair wasn't
really any marriage.  And now if they find
out that I am Lady Holt, I may be prosecuted
for bigamy; in any case, there will be a
frightful scandal, and as I was never legally
Mr. Sinclair's wife I shall lose all the money
he left me and be ruined as well."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said Lucille slowly.  "Of course
they must never know."
</p>

<p>
"You won't betray me, will you?" said
Lavender piteously.
</p>

<p>
"Betray you, my poor dear?" cried
Lucille.  "Whatever are you thinking of to
suppose that I would betray anything that
could do you harm?"  She stroked Lavender's
hand with fond tenderness, and Lavender
turned upon her face and cried; the womanly
sympathy was just what she needed at this
moment, and scarcely any sympathy is so
generous and full as that bestowed upon us
by faithful and loyal servants.  "No," said
Lucille, "it's only because you've been run
down and ill that such a thought could get
into your head.  You are safe so far as I am
concerned.  Besides, now both your husbands
are dead, what affair is it of anybody's who
or what you are?  They'll never find you out
after all these years.  They wouldn't advertise
if there were any other way of getting at
you, and as for the something to your
advantage, if you don't choose to go after
it I don't suppose this Mr. Tracy will raise
any objections; at least, he'll be unlike most
of the lawyers I've ever heard of if he does."
</p>

<p>
By degrees Lavender was comforted and
reassured, and under Lucille's ministrations
recovered much of her former health and
cheerfulness.  Attended by Lucille, she spent
the next few days driving and idling in the
little garden before her house, and reverted
practically to her mode of life before she
first asked Melville to call upon her at The
Vale.  The horror of the tragedy was even
beginning to fade from her mind; she could
never forget it, but she might hope to hear
no more about it.  She was almost beginning
to think she never would, when one day, as
her carriage was turning into Hyde Park she
caught sight of the newspaper posters fastened
against the railings, blazoning forth the
sensational news of the arrest of Mr. Ashley.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap19"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br><br>
IN THE PARK.
</h3>

<p>
Lavender was alone at the time, and the
shock caused by the sight of the poster was
so violent that her carriage had nearly
completed the circuit of the Park before she fully
recovered consciousness.  She very naturally
assumed that the Mr. Ashley referred to on
the poster was Melville, and his arrest would
almost inevitably involve her own.  But as
she was driving from the Marble Arch down
towards Hyde Park Corner the desire to
have some certain knowledge became quite
irresistible, and stopping the coachman under
the trees by the kiosk she got out of the
carriage and walked across to the gate to
buy some of the evening papers which had
been the first to get the news.  She was
afraid to look at them until she got back
into her carriage, in case she should find
mention of her own name and betray her
identity by some access of emotion; so folding
them up she recrossed the Row and sank
back amongst her pillows.  She ordered the
coachman to move away from the throng of
carriages waiting to greet the Queen, and he
walked his horse up to the bandstand, where
no people gather so early in the day.  And
there, with tumultuously beating heart and
nervously shaking hands, Lavender opened
one paper after another and devoured all the
news about the Fairbridge mystery.
</p>

<p>
Her first feeling was, perhaps not
unnaturally, one of relief when she discovered
that it was Ralph and not Melville who had
been arrested.  If the police were capable of
trailing off on such a particularly wrong
scent, they were capable of anything except
detecting the real culprit.  There was, too,
something especially grotesque in their
suspecting Ralph, who, according to Melville,
was a paragon of all the virtues, instead of
Melville, who, according to the same authority,
was not.  But to her first sensation of relief
there succeeded another sequence of thoughts
that filled her with a different emotion.  The
report of the proceedings before the magistrates
was all too brief for anyone so vitally
interested in the matter as Lavender was, but,
womanlike, she read between the lines and
jumped to conclusions with feminine accuracy.
</p>

<p>
Ralph had evidently gained the boathouse
at almost the same moment that she and
Melville left it; he had lingered with luxurious
leisureliness over his toilet, and the police
were bent upon proving that he had had
time and opportunity to commit the murder.
They would find a motive for the crime in the
fact that under this recent will he inherited
practically everything, and even if they
could not bring sufficient evidence to hang
him, they would, by inference and by
circumstantial evidence, weave such a net around
his feet that he could scarcely look to go free
again.  It meant, in short, that an innocent
man would be condemned, and there was only
one thing could save him&mdash;for Lavender herself
to come forward and tell the truth, so bringing
about Melville's death and her own ruin.
</p>

<p>
That, in a nutshell, was the actual state of
affairs.  Ralph's life was in her hands, but
if she saved it she could be under no
misapprehension as to what the cost would be.
Whatever she did now, one of those two
brothers&mdash;her own husband's nephews&mdash;would
have to die at the hands of the common
hangman.
</p>

<p>
Lavender read again the personal paragraphs
about the suspected man, to which
the halfpenny papers always give so much
prominence.  She tried to picture him as he
must be in the flesh, with that crisp, curling
hair, that straightforward expression which
seemed to be his chief characteristic, and
that lithe and muscular frame.  There was
the girl, too, to be considered, this Miss
Austen, to whom Ralph was engaged; her
happiness, like her lover's life, was in
Lavender's hands to save or to destroy.  Which
pair was to be ruined&mdash;Melville and Lavender,
or Ralph and this other girl?
</p>

<p>
For the man suspected of a foul crime, of
which he was entirely innocent, Lavender
felt nothing but pity, but the thought of the
hapless girl who loved him did not touch her
so nearly; if anything, it rather hardened
her heart, although there was nothing cruel
in her nature.  The conflict of interests was
so deadly, its issue fraught with such
tremendous consequences, that she could not be
wholly blamed for her indecision as she sat
in her carriage under the trees and tried to
weigh the facts in a true balance.  Her
immediate surroundings increased the difficulty
of realising the actual value of the facts until
the difficulty became an impossibility.
</p>

<p>
Yet absolute inaction was no less impossible.
She had promised Melville neither to write
nor call, but she must ascertain what he was
doing in view of this new complication.  She
knew he had attended the inquest, and could
imagine something of his relief at the verdict,
but she did not know him well enough to
forecast his behaviour in face of this
extraordinary perversity of fate.  Hitherto she
had regarded him as a well-bred, entertaining
man about town, well endowed with means,
cultivated, and generally charming, one of
many sparkling bubbles in the great bumper
of the world's wine.  The fragments of
conversation she had overheard at the boathouse
proved conclusively that her opinion of him
was ill-founded; he was an unscrupulous
adventurer, capable of lying, meanness,
blackmail&mdash;of any treachery, if that was the
easiest way of getting money to squander on
himself.  Beneath his mask of resourceful
self-possession, too, there lurked a reserve of
passion that, as she had seen with her own
eyes, could on occasion burst out with
volcanic fury and kill whatever obstacle
barred the way to the goal of its desires.
The actual murder might have been
unpremeditated, done in a moment of maniacal
anger, but now that that moment was past
and his normal ingenuity and resourcefulness
were able to have free play again, how would
Melville deal with the problem of saving his
brother without incriminating himself?  She
must find out.
</p>

<p>
Lavender had the carriage turned, and
took her place in the long queue of vehicles
facing the great gates.  She liked to see
Society, although she was not of it, and many
of the people sitting on the grass were well
known to her by sight.  Since Mr. Sinclair's
death, at any rate, she had had a very good
time, and had followed fashion to its usual
haunts at the several seasons of the year,
with the result that she picked up a good
many bowing acquaintances, if no intimate
friends, among the class of people, part of
whose business it is to be seen in the Park
between four and seven o'clock.  And
presently she caught sight of Melville himself
talking to a Duchess, whose love of music
was only one of many claims to the gratitude
of London.  Here was the opportunity of
learning something of what she was so nervously
anxious to know without breaking her promise
to him.  She caught his eye, and pretended
not to observe the obvious look of annoyance
which crossed his face as he raised his hat.
</p>

<p>
"Who is your friend?" the Duchess
asked.  She, too, observed the frown and
wondered what the reason of it was, for her
brief, but adequate, survey of Lavender
assured her practised eye that Melville's
acquaintance was dressed with perfect taste,
and if not presented was presentable.
</p>

<p>
"A very charming woman," Melville answered,
"and a very good one, too, but I won't
ask permission to present her to you, Duchess."
</p>

<p>
"Just as you please," said Her Grace
good-naturedly.  "She wants to talk to you,
so you are released," and Melville, of course,
had no alternative but to join Lavender.
</p>

<p>
She leaned towards him as he approached
the railings.
</p>

<p>
"I have been wanting to see you so much,"
she said eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"That is very good of you," he said in
conventional tones, for the benefit of the
coachman.  "I should have been delighted
to call, but I have been out of town, and
otherwise very much engaged."
</p>

<p>
If the coachman could hear the words he
could not see the meaning glance of warning
flashed from Melville's eyes; Lavender
understood it perfectly, and again was conscious
of the man's indomitable will.  She accepted
his warning, but insisted too.
</p>

<p>
"I want your advice," she said.  "Where
can you see me this afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
"I hardly care to offer advice in the
Park," he replied; "there are so many
distractions, are there not?"
</p>

<p>
Lavender almost lost her temper.  She
leaned nearer to him and spoke softly, so
that only he could hear.
</p>

<p>
"I mean to have a talk with you about&mdash;this,"
and she laid her hand upon the newspapers
by her side.  "Will you come for a
drive with me now?"
</p>

<p>
"Not now," said Melville, "but could you
not be put down at Kensington Gardens?
I will join you there in an hour."
</p>

<p>
Lavender looked at him searchingly.
</p>

<p>
"You will be there, really&mdash;without fail?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, and moved away, seemingly
nonchalant, but in reality cursing the
mischance of running up against her there.  He
had a particular object in being seen in the
Park that afternoon; his presence there
would be interpreted as indicative of perfect
serenity of mind so far as he himself was
concerned, and of complete confidence in his
brother's innocence of the monstrous charge
preferred against him.  But Lavender was
the last person whom he desired to see,
although in their casual meeting there was
probably no element of danger.
</p>

<p>
However, the discussion, if likely to be
futile, could not be avoided, so at the
expiration of the hour he reached the railings
dividing the Gardens from the Park, and
found Lavender awaiting him.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do now?" she
enquired anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"I think you are recklessly imprudent,"
Melville said, ignoring her question.  "Why
must you of all people choose the Park for
your drives just now?"
</p>

<p>
"Why shouldn't I?" she retorted indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"As you have been perusing the papers so
exhaustively," he replied, "you have, doubtless,
seen an advertisement suggesting that
you should apply to some solicitors?"
</p>

<p>
"That Lady Holt should," she corrected
him.  "My name is Sinclair.  There is no
connection between the two people."
</p>

<p>
"I am very glad to hear it," he said
grimly, "but I adhere to my opinion that you
might choose some other locality than Hyde
Park if you wish to take an airing."
</p>

<p>
"And I adhere to mine that there is no
necessity for doing anything of the sort.
Except yourself, not a soul here knows me
by any other name than Lavender Sinclair,
and if they took any interest in me at all,
which they don't, they would fail to
understand why Mrs. Sinclair should desert Hyde
Park because Lady Holt has inherited money."
</p>

<p>
She spoke sarcastically and bitterly, and
Melville did not pursue the point; indeed,
it was just possible that she was right, and
any marked variation from her usual habits
might excite more comment elsewhere and
be more dangerous.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do now?" she
repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"But you can't allow your brother to be
punished for something he never did?"
</p>

<p>
"There is no question of anything of the
kind occurring," he said shortly.  "Local
policemen are bound to do something to
justify their existence, and they have been
inspired to arrest Ralph on suspicion.  But
nothing can be proved against him, and he
will be released at the end of the week."
</p>

<p>
"And then&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"And then, for their own reputation's sake,
they will quietly drop the whole thing, in case
they make themselves still more ridiculous."
</p>

<p>
His coolness amazed her more each time
he had occasion to display it; he had a way
of making the most wildly improbable events
seem probable, of ignoring the existence of
peril until it was upon him, and then of
moving placidly aside and letting it pass
him by as if it were all of no account.  And
this marvellous confidence was, to a certain
extent, infectious.  Alone, Lavender might
fret herself ill and quake before the visions
her fancy painted in the darkness, but in his
company the nightmare vanished and she
reproached herself for her hysterical fears.
If only Melville's abilities and personal
magnetism had been directed towards good ends
he might have achieved greatness, but his
cleverness and charm, utilised as they were,
constituted him a living danger to society.
</p>

<p>
"Do you really think that will happen?"
she said; "really believe it is even possible?"
</p>

<p>
"I really do," he answered.  "Look here,
Lavender.  I've thought about it all&mdash;anticipated
every move; there is only one thing
one cannot foresee, and that is the crass
stupidity of people one doesn't know&mdash;in this
case some Fairbridge constable.  As it
happens, even that is working in my favour.
Ralph was at the boathouse some time before
he saw&mdash;Sir Geoffrey, and he has inherited
everything.  Therefore, according to this
fat-headed policeman, Ralph did the murder.
But what's good enough to arrest a man for,
is not enough to convict him, and there not
only isn't any evidence against Ralph, but
there can't be.  He will be discharged with
a halo of injured innocence round his brow;
and, as I said just now, everybody will be
only too glad to drop the whole thing."
</p>

<p>
For the moment he actually satisfied her
and lifted a load of anxiety from her heart.
Then he broached an idea which he had been
pondering for some days.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you go out of town for a bit,
or, better still, out of England?  I suppose,
in any case, you would be going soon."
</p>

<p>
"You want me out of the way?" she said
interrogatively.
</p>

<p>
"I think it very desirable that you should
be, certainly," he answered.  "You're in a
horribly nervous condition, which is perfectly
natural, and goodness only knows what
might happen if any fresh trouble came upon
you just now in connection with your marriage
to Mr. Sinclair.  There would be all sorts of
litigation, and I can't imagine that you
contemplate giving up what you've got from him
for the sake of having less from somebody else,
leaving alone all considerations of the scandal."
</p>

<p>
It was neatly put, but she was sceptical
about his regard for her interests.  She
flushed as he told her of the annuity Sir
Geoffrey had left her, and of the conditions
under which it was to be obtained, and he
regretted having laid any emphasis upon the
humiliating nature of those restrictions, for
she keenly resented having been so
unnecessarily subjected to this implied affront.
Badly as she might have treated her husband,
she had at least been proud enough to refrain
from asking him for help, and that pride
would have endured, however poor she might
have become subsequent to her desertion of
him.  Melville's duplicity angered her, and
she refused to acquiesce in his wish that she
should run away, and turned a deaf ear to his
further arguments in favour of that course.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said doggedly, "I won't go," and
for the time he gave up trying to persuade her.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," she said, as at last he got up
to go home, "how am I to communicate
with you if I want to see you?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't suppose it will be necessary,"
he answered.
</p>

<p>
"I must know what to do if I consider
it necessary," she persisted.
</p>

<p>
"Well, the only imperative thing is to
refrain from writing," he said.  "Whatever
else you do, don't write anything definite or
indefinite which can be twisted into having
reference to this miserable business.  Send a
verbal message by someone whom you can
really trust, to be delivered only to myself in
person, saying you want to see me and where,
and I will come.  If the messenger doesn't know
what you want to see me about, and doesn't
start gossiping to the servants at my
chambers, I don't suppose any harm can be done."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," Lavender replied, "that
will do, and you may be sure I won't worry
you unless I think it is necessary.  Only
remember, if I do send for you, you must come."
</p>

<p>
"That I promise," said Melville.  "Whom
will you send?"
</p>

<p>
"Lucille," she answered.
</p>

<p>
"Is she reliable?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely," she replied.  "It was she
who showed me the advertisement of
Mr. Tracy wishing to know my whereabouts."
</p>

<p>
"Why on earth did she suppose that
would interest you?" he exclaimed.  "Does
she know&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"She knows I am Lady Holt," said Lavender.
</p>

<p>
"Good God!" cried Melville, and a look
of fear came into his eyes.

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br><br>
MONEY MAKES A DIFFERENCE.
</h3>

<p>
However preposterous the charge against
Ralph might appear to those who knew the
man, the magistrates decided that a <i>primâ
facie</i> case had been made out against him,
and at the end of the adjourned hearing
fully committed him for trial on the capital
charge at the next assizes.  To this disaster
it is possible that his own demeanour
contributed, for throughout the proceedings he
exhibited an impatient indignation that went
far to alienate the sympathy of those who,
within their own limitations, were striving
to discharge their duty faithfully.  Mr. Tracy
on several occasions had difficulty in restraining
his client's temper, and, at a final interview
with him after his committal, implored
him to control himself more effectually at
the assizes.
</p>

<p>
"But they are such hopeless imbeciles,"
Ralph protested.  "Thank goodness, the
decision won't rest with any Justice Shallow
next time!  If it did, I should inevitably
hang."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tracy quieted him somewhat, and
Gwendolen, who also was permitted to see
him before he was removed, did much to
restore his faith in human nature, but
everybody at the Manor House was oppressed by
a sense of impending calamity.  Innocent
men have met death upon the gallows before
now, and faith is such a different thing from
proof.  In the meantime, however, there
was an interval during which it might be
possible to get upon some other trail, and all
Ralph's friends swore to leave no stone
unturned to prove his innocence.
</p>

<p>
As a first step, Gwendolen determined to
enlist Melville's active co-operation, and with
her mother called upon him at his chambers,
having previously let him know he might
expect them.  Melville was sympathy incarnate,
and, although he confessed that he did
not see in what way he could be of use,
promised to be unremitting in his enquiries
and to spare neither time nor trouble to
bring about the acquittal which he desired
as much as they did.  What he had said to
Lavender in Kensington Gardens he repeated
now to Gwendolen, and with very similar
effect, so that she went away cheered and
hopeful and full of gratitude to him.
</p>

<p>
The cab containing them had scarcely
driven away before another visitor arrived
in the person of Mr. Tracy.  The old gentleman
was evidently unaware that the Austens
had just called upon Melville on the same
errand, and Melville did not enlighten him;
the least suggestion of mystery had an odd
fascination for him, and from the possession
of exclusive information, however trifling in
itself, he always derived satisfaction and a
sense of power.  In presence of the solicitor
his pose was different; he resented the
stigma cast upon the family name, was not
free from apprehensions about the issue of
the trial, and agreed with Ralph in
denouncing the stupidity of the police; but
he had no practical suggestion to offer, and
again did not see in what way he could be
of use.  He rather inclined to the idea that
excess of activity might be construed to
his brother's disadvantage.
</p>

<p>
"You never know what these criminal
lawyers may not make of trifles most
praiseworthy in themselves," he said.  "If I were
to be seen all over the place trying to pump
everybody they would as likely as not protest
that I was trying to suborn evidence for our
side; whereas, if I keep myself aloof and
lead my usual life it will, at any rate, show
that I'm confident of Ralph's innocence and
feel no anxiety."
</p>

<p>
"But you must feel anxiety," said Mr. Tracy
irritably.  "Your brother is in a
deuced ticklish position, Mr. Ashley."
</p>

<p>
"I know," Melville answered, with a
far-away look upon his face.  "I wouldn't be
in his place for a million of money."  That
was almost the only absolutely sincere remark
he made upon the subject.  "Look here, Mr. Tracy,"
he said suddenly, "in confidence, do
you really think Ralph might swing for
this?"
</p>

<p>
"I think it's quite possible," the lawyer
said.  "It's a capital charge, and if the jury
bring in a verdict of guilty the sentence must
be death; there's no alternative.  Whether
it would be carried out or commuted to penal
servitude is another matter, as to which I
have formed no opinion."
</p>

<p>
"No jury can convict," said Melville
obstinately; "there's no evidence."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tracy would not argue the point.
That would be done exhaustively by-and-bye;
his present business was to stimulate
Melville into activity, and it was not
progressing as he liked.
</p>

<p>
"What we have to do at the present
time," he said, "is to make all possible
enquiries and follow up any possible clue,
however shadowy it may seem at first.  I
want you to exhaust the neighbourhood of
Fairbridge; you know everybody there.  Go
round the inns and little shops and the locks,
and encourage the people to talk.  You
may hear of some stranger having been seen
about there at the time, hanging about the
bars or the towing-path, or something of that
sort; if you do, follow it up."
</p>

<p>
"But all that means time and money,"
said Melville.  "I can't afford either."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tracy was surprised.
</p>

<p>
"My dear sir," he said, "you must make
the time, and as for the money, that is my
affair, as the solicitor for the defence.  I
will pay a hundred into your account this
afternoon, if you will tell me where you bank."
</p>

<p>
"That simplifies things for me," said
Melville, imparting the necessary
information without too much alacrity, but yet
making sure that Mr. Tracy should make no
mistake as to which branch of the bank he
honoured with his custom.  "I don't see
why I shouldn't confess to you that I am
hard up, and Sir Geoffrey's will was like a
blow between the eyes."
</p>

<p>
"It was an amazing business," Mr. Tracy
admitted.  "About this Lady Holt, Mr. Ashley;
had you any idea of her existence?"
</p>

<p>
"Not the faintest," said Melville unblushingly.
</p>

<p>
"Nor why you should be excluded from
the will?  Pardon me, if I seem to be asking
too much."
</p>

<p>
"The whole thing was like a bolt from
the blue," Melville replied.  "As a matter
of fact I had been on particularly good terms
with my uncle just lately, which makes it
all the more incomprehensible to me.  By
the way," he added, with the charm of
manner which he knew so well how to assume
upon occasion, "I hope you will forget what
I said to Ralph after you read the will that
day.  I was horribly mortified, and I daresay
I said more than I really meant."
</p>

<p>
"Whatever you might have said I should
have attributed to a very natural disappointment,"
Mr. Tracy said pleasantly.  "That
is all forgotten, so far as I am concerned,
and I know I may call upon you now with
confidence."
</p>

<p>
"With perfect confidence," Melville
answered.  "If you think I may be able to
find out anything by pottering about
Fairbridge, I'll go down and begin operations
to-morrow, but I'm not sanguine."
</p>

<p>
"At any rate, your evidence will be valuable
to show the terms on which your brother
stood with your uncle.  They were always
particularly good friends, weren't they?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Melville moodily.  "Ralph
was always Sir Geoffrey's favourite."
</p>

<p>
"And he was delighted, I know, about
your brother's engagement to Miss Austen,"
Mr. Tracy continued, unconsciously rubbing
salt into Melville's sores.  "It was his
intention to make most handsome settlements,
which would have rendered the young couple
quite independent."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay," said Melville.  "Well, there
it is.  I am quite ready to testify that Ralph
was always like a very affectionate son to
Sir Geoffrey, and that, as far as I can see,
there was not only no reason why he should
commit such a crime as he is alleged to have
committed, but every reason why he shouldn't.
Ralph and I have never been very chummy,
but nobody would do more to clear him of
this preposterous charge than I would.  That
goes without saying.  What makes me want
to kick myself is that I can't do something
that seems more practical than simply go
into court and say what everybody knows
already."
</p>

<p>
"It will all help," said Mr. Tracy; "and,
after all, the burden of proof rests on the
prosecution."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so," said Melville.  "That was my
point at the start.  I don't see how evidence
can be manufactured, and unless it can
be, Ralph is bound to be acquitted.  Still,
I'm your man, Mr. Tracy, and as you suggest
that I might pick up some clue from local
gossip I'll be off to-morrow, and report
progress as soon as I make any."
</p>

<p>
He spoke heartily, and Mr. Tracy shook his
outstretched hand, well content with the
result of his call.
</p>

<p>
"It's an ill wind that blows no one
any good," he thought as he descended in
the lift.  "If one result of this magisterial
blunder is to make those two fine young
fellows better friends, it won't have been all
wasted; and as for the trial I don't suppose
there will really be any miscarriage of justice."
</p>

<p>
Sir Geoffrey had appointed Mr. Tracy
executor of his will, and the old fellow
travelled to Fairbridge every evening, and
dined and slept at the Manor House.  He
found the arrangement a very pleasant one
in many ways, and incidentally it enabled
him to do Gwendolen good by employing her
as his secretary in dealing with the mass of
business involved in the settlement of so
considerable an estate, and thus distracting
her thoughts from her terrible anxiety for
at least a portion of the twenty-four hours.
He felt confident that he would sooner or
later come across some documents relating
to the mysterious marriage, and he carefully
perused all the letters which Sir Geoffrey
had preserved.  There was, however, no trace
of any correspondence between the husband
and wife.  It was, of course, possible that
they had not been apart after their marriage
until the final separation came, but still it
was singular that among so many letters
as Sir Geoffrey had kept there should be none
from this particular person&mdash;not even letters
written during the period of courtship.
</p>

<p>
It was in this direction that Mr. Tracy
had turned Gwendolen's especial attention,
desiring her, also, to look carefully among a
rather large assortment of photographs and
miniatures for anything that might
conceivably be a portrait of Lady Holt.  He
was anxious to trace the whereabouts of the
widow for reasons quite apart from his
obligation to carry out Sir Geoffrey's
testamentary instructions in every particular.
</p>

<p>
Questions would certainly be asked about
her at Ralph's trial, and his professional
pride was piqued at his present entire
ignorance of the story.
</p>

<p>
After leaving Melville's chambers he went
back to his office in Lincoln's Inn Fields,
and issued another advertisement to the
Press, offering a substantial reward to anyone
who would give him information as to the
whereabouts of Lady Holt.
</p>

<p>
"It is only her business to apply to me
for her own advantage," he reflected; "it is
anybody's business to tell me where she is
if it's made worth their while," and convinced
that the money spent on this advertisement
might prove to have been well spent, he
went down to Fairbridge in an equable
frame of mind.
</p>

<p>
He was surprised when Gwendolen told
him she had seen Melville that afternoon.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder why he did not mention it," he
said, but although his training inclined him
to be suspicious, his suspicions on this
occasion were easily dispelled, especially as his
impressions of Melville's good disposition
towards his brother tallied with those formed
by the two ladies.
</p>

<p>
"I consider that he behaved in a very
gentlemanly and straightforward fashion,"
he said, and Mrs. Austen cordially agreed.
"He was diffident as to his power to help,
but directly I suggested something I thought
he might do, he undertook it with alacrity.
That is quite the proper spirit."
</p>

<p>
And privately, to his own mind, he
admitted that Melville could not explain to
Mrs. Austen how his financial position would
have hampered his activities, but for that
little cheque on account of out-of-pocket
expenditure, and he was filled with admiration
of Melville's delicacy and tact as well.  He
had no doubt but what Melville Ashley was
a deeply-injured man, and resolved to interpret
Ralph's instructions liberally, and pay
in another hundred pounds to Melville's
account at the bank.
</p>

<p>
Later in the evening, Gwendolen came to
him in the library and laid some photographs
in front of him.
</p>

<p>
"I found these in an old bureau," she
said.  "Do you think one of them might be
Lady Holt?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tracy looked at them eagerly; two
of them he laid aside, but the third he kept
in his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Those two I am pretty sure I recognise;
they are old photographs, but the faces are
familiar to me, though I cannot put names
to them at the moment.  This one is different.
Taken at Norwich, I see.  If the photographer
is still there we may ascertain whose likeness
it is.  I will make enquiries at once, and
hope something may come of it.  Thank you,
my dear.  This may be exceedingly useful,"
and after examining it earnestly, as if to
impress the picture on his memory, he put it
carefully away with the other papers relating
to Sir Geoffrey's last will and testament.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br><br>
THE RESULT OF THE TRIAL.
</h3>

<p>
If fate was playing a joke upon Ralph Ashley,
her humour erred upon the side of grimness.
His friends met with no success in their
endeavours to find some other possible culprit,
and, on the other hand, a succession of small
incidents occurred, all of which seemed to
lead him on inevitably a little nearer to the
gallows.  Of these, the most important was
the finding of a revolver in the gun-room at
the Manor House and a quantity of bullets
similar to that which had penetrated Sir
Geoffrey's heart.  At the trial this seemed to
be the most conclusive point in the case for
the Crown.  There was no indication that
it had been recently used, but the same
remark applied to all the weapons in the
little armoury, all of them being kept in
perfect condition.  The explanation of its
existence was given frankly by Ralph and
corroborated by Melville; it was one of two
given years before by Sir Geoffrey to his
nephews, but to which of the two it properly
belonged neither of the brothers could declare;
both averred they had not used them for a
very long time, and the damning fact
remained that the other pistol was missing.
It had been thrown away, the prosecution
suggested, after the tragedy, and that all the
ammunition had not also been destroyed
was due to that oversight of which every
criminal is capable, and but for which many
more murderers would escape conviction.
</p>

<p>
Ralph was haggard and pulled down by
confinement and by want of sleep; if he
were a criminal, he was, at any rate, no actor,
and his obvious nervousness was interpreted
by many as symptomatic of a guilty conscience.
He listened attentively to the entire
proceedings with visibly increasing consternation
and dismay, and it was not until Melville
took up his position in the witness-box that
any gleam of hope appeared upon his face.
</p>

<p>
Melville once more engrossed the sympathy
of a court; he was so distressed upon his
brother's account, so anxious to testify to his
integrity of character, so ready, and yet so
concise, in his replies, that he made an ideal
witness.
</p>

<p>
"Ralph was always my uncle's favourite,"
he said again, with a rather pathetic smile;
"they were just like father and son."  No,
he had never heard of any difference of
opinion between them, and was convinced
they had never had any quarrel.  It was
impossible, he protested, that Ralph could or
would have committed such a crime.  His
generous indignation warmed Ralph's heart,
and was subsequently commented on with
approbation by counsel for the Crown in his
concluding address to the jury, although, as
that great lawyer pointed out, it did not
affect the issue.  What was more important
was the admission he was rather skilfully
beguiled into making that on one occasion he
had known his brother to be embarrassed by
want of money.  An apparently trivial
question had been put as to his knowledge of
Ralph's financial position, and Melville
answered it candidly; both of them were
absolutely dependent on Sir Geoffrey's bounty,
both received a liberal allowance, and on one
occasion Sir Geoffrey had paid a considerable
sum in which Melville himself was indebted.
Presumably, therefore, he would have done
the same for Ralph, to whom he was, by
common consent, more attached.
</p>

<p>
"In short, you are not aware that your
brother has ever been in want of ready
money?"
</p>

<p>
Melville hesitated, coloured, and was lost.
Reluctantly, and only as the result of a long
series of skilfully worded questions, he let out
the fact that Ralph had once applied to him
for an immediate loan of a hundred pounds.
He was at Monte Carlo at the time, and Ralph
wrote from Fairbridge.  Yes, he supposed
that Ralph might have applied to Sir Geoffrey,
but it did not follow that he had done so and
been refused.  The inference was unwarrantable,
he declared warmly, but his protest failed
to have effect, and the harm was done.  In
reply to a few further questions, he accounted
moodily for his own time on the day of the
murder.  He had gone out for a walk after a
late breakfast, and in the afternoon had
remained at home, owing to the storm.  The
telegram announcing his uncle's death was
not brought to him at once, as his valet was
off duty.  The manager of the chambers
brought it up with some letters when, on
waking up from a doze, Melville rang for tea.
He was obviously downcast by the information
previously extracted from him, and when
he finally left the box, it was felt that he had
slipped the noose around his brother's neck.
</p>

<p>
Of the rest of the proceedings Melville had
no knowledge at first hand.  His nerves,
strong and finely tempered as they were,
could not stand the tension, and he hurried
to the hotel, where he had engaged a private
room.  There he paced up and down like a
caged beast, unable to think coherently, and
only waiting with horrible anxiety for the
verdict.  In the still silence of the court,
Gwendolen sat motionless, her whole attitude
a prayer, and downstairs Ralph waited, glad
to escape the observation of the hundreds
of curious eyes.  But to neither of them, to
whom the verdict meant so much, did the
time seem so appallingly long as it seemed to
Melville, nor was their anguish any thing like his.
</p>

<p>
Three hours dragged by, each one composed
of sixty minutes of agony, and then the
waiter brought a note to him.  He tore it
open, afraid to read its contents, yet unable
to endure another second of suspense.  The
jury had been unable to agree, and the case
was sent back to be tried again.
</p>

<p>
Melville groaned.  So it all had to be gone
through again, all the examination and
cross-examination and re-examination, all the
hypocrisy and ingenuity and deceit, and at
the end perhaps another murder, or perhaps
suicide; for Ralph's conviction would be
equivalent to the one, and his acquittal
might be procurable only by the revelation
of the truth, which would involve the other.
Melville had honestly expected his brother's
acquittal, had been quite sincere in his words
of encouragement to Gwendolen; and now
there was this miserable, ineffectual
conclusion to the solemn farce.
</p>

<p>
White lipped, wide eyed, with furrows
scored across his brow, he turned to the
waiter and forced a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's the end of it to-day.  Order a
fly to take me to the station.  I'll go up by
the next train," and writing a note to
Mr. Tracy to say he could be got at at once in
Jermyn Street if required, he presently
returned to town.
</p>

<p>
In the cells below the court Mr. Tracy
found a very different man awaiting him
from the one he had last seen in the dock.
The intolerant indignation with which Ralph
had listened to the various suggestions of the
prosecution, and the scorn with which he
had heard the address to the jury, with its
denunciation of his supposed ingratitude and
treachery, were all gone.  He was pale and
exhausted by the long day in the crowded court,
but he was also dignified and self-possessed.  He
turned to the solicitor with a whimsical smile.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know whether to be relieved or
disappointed.  Since some of the twelve good
men and true were not convinced of my
innocence, I suppose I ought to be grateful
that things are not worse than they are.
Did I behave myself better to-day?"
</p>

<p>
"Much better," Mr. Tracy answered.
"You know," he added seriously, "the
circumstantial evidence was very strong, and
although, as I have maintained all along,
the probabilities are always against a
miscarriage of justice, you are not out of the
wood yet.  Mr. Ashley, if the jury had
convicted you we should only have had a matter
of three weeks in which to discover new facts.
I think you ought to be grateful that we
have three months."
</p>

<p>
"That is true," said Ralph soberly.  "But
what a three months for me!  Is there no
chance of bail?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tracy shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"No.  You must go through with it, but
a great deal may happen in three months,
and it won't be for want of trying if I don't
get you out long before then.  Now, Mr. Ashley,
I have two questions to ask you.
First, do you know who this is?"
</p>

<p>
Ralph looked at the photograph which
Mr. Tracy showed him.
</p>

<p>
"To the best of my knowledge I've never
seen this before, and I'm certain I don't
know the original.  Who is it?"
</p>

<p>
"I have an idea it is Lady Holt," Mr. Tracy
answered, "but I dare say I shall find
out soon.  It is curious how everything
seems to be in a conspiracy against you.
The man who took that photograph retired
from business a few years ago and is now
dead.  I hoped I might find out the name
of the lady from him, but he's dead and the
books can't be traced.  Now the next point.
The hundred pounds you asked your brother
to lend you; what about that?"
</p>

<p>
Ralph's brows contracted.
</p>

<p>
"I asked him for it," he said curtly.
"That's true enough; but I didn't get it."
</p>

<p>
"That don't matter," Mr. Tracy retorted.
"The fact that you asked for it did you a
lot of harm to-day."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see why Melville should have
referred to it at all."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he couldn't help himself," the
solicitor said.  "Some of those fellows are
marvellous at making you say more than you
mean to say.  Why did you ask him for it?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I was a silly ass," Ralph answered
viciously, "and didn't like to ask Sir
Geoffrey.  I never did ask him for a sovereign
in my life; goodness knows he gave me enough
without that.  Do you remember selling out
some railway stock for me a little time
ago?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mr. Tracy, "and advising
you not to do it, but you would not listen."
</p>

<p>
"That was the time," Ralph said.  "I
had bought a yacht for Gwen and didn't
want to give it to her not paid for, and you
were slower than usual, and I was cleaned
out, and only just engaged.  And I asked
Melville to lend me a hundred till you settled
up.  Of course, Sir Geoffrey would have
given it to me if I had asked him, but he
would have insisted on its being a gift, not a
loan, and I wanted the boat to be my present
to Gwen, not his."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll see that some of that comes out
next time," said Mr. Tracy.  "I could see
that it made a very bad impression to-day."
</p>

<p>
"There's a continuation to the story,"
said Ralph, with a hard look in his eyes,
"and since Melville has chosen to reopen
it, I don't see why I should not tell you the
rest.  He did not answer my letter, did not
send me the money."
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said Mr. Tracy.
</p>

<p>
"He came back from Monte Carlo broke to
the world and fetched up at Fairbridge.  I
happened to go away that night and just
missed him, but he saw Sir Geoffrey and
asked for some money.  Sir Geoffrey said he
wouldn't give him another sixpence, and
asked what he had done with two hundred
and fifty pounds he'd had six weeks before.
I'm blest if Melville didn't produce my letter
and say he'd lent me a hundred of it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said Mr. Tracy; "and what happened then?"
</p>

<p>
"The dear old chap begged his pardon and
paid him the hundred pounds for me.  If
ever there was a rank swindle that was one.
When I came home next day he began to
pitch into me for asking Melville instead of
him for help, and, of course, the whole thing
came out at once."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mr. Tracy.  "What did Sir
Geoffrey say?"
</p>

<p>
"He said rather a lot," Ralph answered
grimly.  "He was going to instruct you to
take proceedings against Melville for getting
money under false pretences, but I persuaded
him to let me repay him the hundred pounds
and take the matter up myself.  He agreed&mdash;rather
reluctantly&mdash;and that was the end of
the matter, except that I had a bit of a
rumpus with Melville, who owes me the
money to this day."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tracy was much more interested than
he allowed Ralph to perceive; the story let
in a flood of light upon much that he had
not been able to understand.
</p>

<p>
"Then your brother is extravagant, I
suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Money runs through his fingers like
water through a sieve," Ralph answered.
"Just six weeks before that Sir Geoffrey
wiped off all his debts, as he admitted to-day;
he gave him two hundred and fifty pounds,
and told him to go to the deuce; Melville
blew the lot at Monte Carlo, came home, got
that extra hundred out of Sir Geoffrey, and
went away.  And the very next day he
turned up again at Fairbridge, had a long
session with the old chap, and got round him
so far that he stayed a week at the Manor
House and began to tap him again, just as
casually as ever.  I couldn't understand it
then, and I can't now.  Sir Geoffrey never
talked about him after we had that palaver
about my supposed debt, but I am quite
clear it was because of that swindle that
Melville got himself disinherited.  Sir Geoffrey
didn't like his gambling, but he liked the
other thing less&mdash;and I don't wonder."
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you tell me something about
this on the day of the funeral," Mr. Tracy
asked, "when I read the will?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well," said Ralph, "I'm a slow-witted
chap, you know, and you were in a
hurry; and, besides, it's not a pretty story.
I wouldn't have mentioned it now, only
Melville brought it up so unnecessarily.
You had better know the rights of it since
you think what he said did me harm to-day."
</p>

<p>
For the time being, Ralph forgot the
position in which he actually stood, and
turned as if to accompany Mr. Tracy to the
door when he rose to leave, but the sight of
the warders, who had retired to the far end
of the room, re-awakened him to the fact
that he was a prisoner, and he flushed as he
put out his hand.
</p>

<p>
"I'm awfully grateful, sir, for all you have
done and are doing for me.  If you succeed
and clear my name, I may be able to show
my gratitude practically."
</p>

<p>
"When I succeed, you mean," Mr. Tracy
corrected him smilingly.  "I must say good-bye
now, but next time I come I hope I shall
have good news for you.  Don't brood over
your grievance, Mr. Ashley.  That may seem
a counsel of perfection, but try to act up to
it, if only for the sake of that charming young
lady who is waiting for you.  Faith in God
and a clear conscience can make even prison
tolerable, and nobody can rob you of those."
</p>

<p>
He put his bag down upon the table while
he shook both Ralph's hands violently.  Then
he blew his nose with equal violence, seized
his bag, and hurried away, scolding himself
inwardly for being so upset by so commonplace
an incident as an interview with a
client.  Not until he was in the railway
carriage and on his way to town did he
recover his usual equanimity.  With his
characteristic stare of mild surprise he
surveyed the bag which reposed on the seat
opposite to him, but the only remark which
escaped his lips was when at length he
removed his eyes from it, as if he had
ascertained what was in it by some mental
adaptation of the X ray process.  His remark was
brief and pregnant: "Well, I'm hanged."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br><br>
MR. TRACY BECOMES ACTIVE.
</h3>

<p>
Melville's faculty of reading character did
not err when it satisfied him that he might
rely upon Lavender Sinclair keeping
faithfully any secret which she had passed her
word not to betray.  There are plenty of
women of whom the same might be said, all
the gibes of all the cynics notwithstanding.
But it also told him that he might be
ill-advised in leaving her too much alone,
especially just now, when the papers were so
full of the trial and of speculations as to her
own existence and whereabouts.  The morning
after the abortive trial, therefore, he
determined to pay her an early visit, and
donning a new suit of mourning, and an
expression suited to the part he was being
compelled to play in the Fairbridge tragedy,
he walked out of his chambers as soon as he
had finished his customary "brunch."
</p>

<p>
Thus it happened that he was not at home
when a few minutes after his departure
Mr. Tracy, who capriciously elected to walk
upstairs without enquiring of the
commissionaire whether Mr. Ashley was within, or
troubling the lift attendant to convey him
to the top floor, knocked at the outer door
of his self-contained suite of apartments.
Jervis opened the door.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ashley has only just gone out," he
said, "and he gave me no instructions as to
when he would return."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tracy was visibly distressed; he was
also elderly, and rather out of breath from
scaling so many stairs.
</p>

<p>
"It is of the first importance that I should
see him to-day.  You have no idea where
he has gone&mdash;whether I might find him at
his club, for instance?"
</p>

<p>
Jervis could not say.  Mr. Ashley was a
member of several clubs, but it was scarcely
likely that he would visit any of them so
early in the day.  Could not the gentleman
leave a card and call again?
</p>

<p>
The gentleman would much prefer to
wait on the chance of Mr. Ashley's returning,
but Jervis seemed so disconcerted by the
suggestion, and so much at a loss for a civil
way of getting rid of the visitor, that
Mr. Tracy took pity on him.
</p>

<p>
"In point of fact," he said, "I am Mr. Ashley's
family solicitor, and you may have
heard of the melancholy affair at Fairbridge
Manor.  I must see Mr. Ashley immediately,
in order to prepare for the new trial that is
now necessary."
</p>

<p>
No servant could fail to recognise the
paramount importance of such a visitor, or
take the responsibility of sending him away
without explicit orders to that effect, and
Jervis admitted Mr. Tracy.  He did more,
influenced perhaps by the transference of two
new coins, a sovereign and a shilling from
the lawyer's pocket to his own.
</p>

<p>
"I come of an old-fashioned school,"
Mr. Tracy said with a smile, "and must insist
upon your accepting the shilling as well.
There's a sentimental difference as well as a
pecuniary one between a pound and a guinea,
and I never cease to regret that guineas are
coined no more.  No thanks, I beg.  I am
really excessively obliged to you for allowing
me to come in and await Mr. Ashley's return."
</p>

<p>
So Mr. Tracy gained his point, and Jervis
never suspected that for more than half an
hour he had been waiting in the tailor's shop
opposite, watching for Melville to emerge
before climbing the steep staircase to the
little bachelor flat.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ashley always takes a very late
breakfast," Jervis remarked as he proceeded
with his work of clearing the table.  "May
I get you some luncheon, sir?  I am sure it
would be Mr. Ashley's wish that I should
ask you."
</p>

<p>
"'Pon my word now, that's very obliging
of you," Mr. Tracy answered; "very obliging
indeed.  I always breakfast very early myself,
and I am distinctly hungry.  If I shall not be
causing anybody any inconvenience I should
be uncommonly glad of some luncheon."
</p>

<p>
So Jervis relaid the table, and after several
colloquies with the chef, conducted through
the medium of the speaking tube outside,
produced a meal which did great credit to
the establishment, and which Mr. Tracy, to
use his own language, found "vastly
appetising."  And while he gave proof of his
appreciation of this vicarious hospitality by
satisfying an appetite which would have been
creditable to a young fellow of twenty, he
entertained the valet with a chatty,
circumstantial account of the famous murder trial,
in which he knew he must be interested.
Men of the old school, to which Mr. Tracy
prided himself on belonging, are not prone
to hold such animated conversations with
other people's servants as Mr. Tracy held
with Melville's valet now.  Jervis was
probably unaware of this, but, in all the
circumstances, it is not surprising that he should be
completely satisfied of the visitor's good
faith, and chat as freely as the visitor did
himself; which was precisely according to
Mr. Tracy's anticipations, and was the sole
reason of his going there at all.
</p>

<p>
"I daresay Mr. Ashley is very much upset
by the suspicion attaching to his brother,"
Mr. Tracy said, as he attacked a second
kidney.
</p>

<p>
"I don't doubt he is," Jervis replied,
"but he's not the sort of gentleman to show
it."
</p>

<p>
"Not given to showing his feelings, you
mean," said the lawyer; "his uncle, Sir
Geoffrey Holt, was just like that.  But it
doesn't follow that those very self-possessed
people feel things less than the others do.
You don't agree with me, eh?" for Jervis
looked doubtful.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think Mr. Ashley minds things as
much as I should if I were in his place," the
valet answered; "that is to say, not some
things."
</p>

<p>
"Little things, perhaps," Mr. Tracy suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Well, not what I should call little things,"
said Jervis, who was by no means disinclined
to criticise one of his gentlemen, as he termed
the several tenants of the chambers whom
he had the privilege of valeting.  "For
instance, if his breakfast don't please him,
or his boots don't shine enough, you'd think
the house was on fire by the way he rings
the bell, but in what I should call vexations
he doesn't even begin to seem worried,
when I should be off my head with scheming
and devising."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tracy laughed.
</p>

<p>
"To have the power of not being worried
by worries must be a great blessing sometimes,
but the word has such different meanings for
different people.  A man like Mr. Ashley,
with comfortable quarters and first-class
attendance, and well-to-do people belonging
to him, can't have real anxieties."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know about all that," Jervis
said sententiously.  "Nobody can see very
far into anybody else's life.  What I should
be rich on, Mr. Ashley may be poor on, but
I've known lots of times when he's been in
difficulties, so to speak, and never turned a
hair.  Those are poached eggs on spinach, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, I'll take some," said Mr. Tracy,
who would have gone on eating until dinner-time
if only so he could have prolonged the
conversation; "but what do you mean by
difficulties?"
</p>

<p>
Jervis laughed a little in his turn.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, all this is quite between
ourselves?  It would never do if Mr. Ashley
knew I'd remarked upon it, but people can't
help seeing what goes on under their noses if
they're not blind, and gentlemen's gentlemen
see more than other people, to say nothing
of their having to do with it in a manner of
speaking.  Well, there was one time I remember
particularly, because it seemed so funny&mdash;the
sort of thing nobody but Mr. Ashley would
have thought of, yet it came quite natural-like
to him.  It was last time he came home
from Monte Carlo, where he'd been making
money for the bank.  I don't believe he had
a penny piece to call his own, and he was
going out in the evening.  'Jervis,' he says,
'put out my dress clothes early; I'm dining
out to-night.'  So I went to do it, but couldn't
find any shirts in his portmanteau.  When
he went away I'd sent all his linen to the
laundry, and they wouldn't send it back
without he paid the bill, which was a pretty
long one.  'Have you any shirts, sir?' I
asked, and he took me up, vexed-like.  'How
the devil am I to know?' he says; 'find
some.'  Course I had to tell him about the
laundry, and he colours up and says he'll
be hanged if he writes them a cheque."
</p>

<p>
"How did you manage?" Mr. Tracy enquired.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't manage at all," Jervis announced;
"that's what I'm telling you.  It worried
me at the time, although it wasn't me who
was going out, but Mr. Ashley takes it all
as a matter of course.  'Go over to the
Burlington Arcade,' he says, like a lord,
'and tell my hosiers to send over three dozen
and put them down to my account.'"
</p>

<p>
"Did they do it?" Mr. Tracy asked.
</p>

<p>
"Do it?" said Jervis scornfully; "of
course they did it.  Seems to me people will
do anything in this world if you only bluff
them enough.  Still, there's a case to show
what I mean.  I should never have thought
of getting three dozen shirts on credit because
I couldn't pay my laundry bill, but to
Mr. Ashley it was the natural thing to do."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tracy was really amused, but he
thought it a most illuminating anecdote, and
followed up the vein it opened.
</p>

<p>
"So Mr. Ashley plays at Monte Carlo,
does he?  Well, one wants a long purse for
that game.  Does he entertain much here?
He very well might where things are so well
done."
</p>

<p>
Jervis appreciated the compliment.
</p>

<p>
"Only a very occasional supper," he
answered.  "I'm sure I'm sorry he doesn't
have company oftener."  Jervis's regret may,
perhaps, have been due to financial
considerations, but he hastened to admit that
Mr. Ashley's failure to receive his friends in
Jermyn Street made the work lighter for his
attendants.  "Of course, it makes the place
an easier one for me," he said, "and I will
say that, although there are times when for
weeks together he doesn't know where to lay
his hand on a shilling, Mr. Ashley is very
considerate and very free with his money
when he's got any.  Often and often he's
thrown me over a couple of sovereigns and
said I might find them useful if I knew
anybody who would like to go up to Hampton
Court or have an afternoon at Kempton&mdash;which
I do."
</p>

<p>
He became anecdotal, and Mr. Tracy found
it a not very easy matter to get him back to
the subject of Melville's habits without making
his purpose too apparent, but he did it at
last.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Jervis, in reply to some indirect
question, "Mr. Ashley hardly ever has ladies
here.  There was two called the other day,
and one came to tea once."
</p>

<p>
"The two were the Austens, I expect,"
said Mr. Tracy.  "Miss Austen is engaged
to be married to Mr. Ashley's brother."
</p>

<p>
"Is she?" said Jervis, with interest;
"poor young lady!  Do you think
Mr. Ashley&mdash;our Mr. Ashley, I mean&mdash;is going to
marry the other lady?  She's the only one
I've ever known come here alone."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, I'm sure," Mr. Tracy
answered.  "I don't even know who she was."
</p>

<p>
"Her name was Sinclair," Jervis said.
"She was a lady, anyone could see, and
beautifully dressed.  She must know him
very well, because I heard her call him
Melville.  It was the very day before the
murder at Fairbridge that she called and
took tea with Mr. Ashley."
</p>

<p>
"The day before, or the day it happened?"
Mr. Tracy asked.
</p>

<p>
"The day before," said Jervis.  "The
day of the murder Mr. Ashley didn't go out.
I know that because he happened to say he
would be going out and he wouldn't want
me.  So I went to Hendon, but when I got
back Mr. Ashley had been telegraphed for,
and the manager told me he was in a terrible
way because he had stopped at home after
all, owing to the storm, and the telegram
wasn't brought up to him at once."
</p>

<p>
With all this, and much more, did Jervis
entertain Mr. Tracy, in whom, as Mr. Ashley's
family solicitor, he felt he might place entire
confidence.  He removed the luncheon, set
the room in order, and attended to his various
duties in Melville's bedroom, brushing his
dress clothes and laying them out in
preparation for the evening, but still Melville
did not return.  When the clock upon the
mantelpiece chimed half-past three Mr. Tracy
began to show signs that even his patience
was becoming exhausted.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid that after all I shall have
to give it up," he said, with evident reluctance.
"If you will still further oblige me with
writing materials, I will leave a note for
Mr. Ashley, asking him to give me an early
appointment."
</p>

<p>
Jervis produced the necessary tools, and
Mr. Tracy wrote the little note.
</p>

<p>
"I have told him how attentive you have
been," he said to the valet, "and perhaps
you will allow me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Another guinea changed hands, and Jervis
was profuse in his expressions of gratitude;
none the less he seemed a shade uneasy.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, anything that I have said,"
he began, but Mr. Tracy cut him short.
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely between ourselves, I assure
you; ab-so-lutely between ourselves," and,
with a sagacious nod of the head, the old
fellow began to take his departure.  At the
door he hesitated a moment, for a card tray
caught his eye.  "Some of these young men
are terrible sticklers for etiquette," he said,
scrutinising it closely; "perhaps I ought to
add my card to these," and while fumbling
in his pocket for his card-case he contrived
to get a glimpse of Mrs. Sinclair's card, which
Jervis had brought up the day before the
tragedy.  He had not time to see the number
of the house, but The Vale, South Kensington,
was quite enough for his immediate needs,
and as he turned into Piccadilly Circus he
gave utterance to a little sound, half grunt,
half chuckle, expressive of the utmost satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"It's cost me two guineas and a wholly
unnecessary suit of clothes, but I shall be
very much astonished if it doesn't prove a
good investment.  Still, if it doesn't, the
estate can bear it.  'Pon my word, if my
name weren't Tracy, I should think it must
be Slater!"
</p>

<p>
Well pleased with himself, he climbed on
to the top of a Putney omnibus, and employed
the time occupied in the journey to South
Kensington Station in arranging his mental
notes.  He had already heard enough to
verify the impression gleaned from Ralph
that Melville was an inveterate gambler, and
that was quite enough to explain Sir Geoffrey's
hitherto incomprehensible action in
disinheriting his younger nephew.
</p>

<p>
"It only shows how even an experienced
old lawyer like myself can be taken in by a
plausible young rascal," he thought with
much humility.  "I dare say he is a waster,
who tired Sir Geoffrey out.  It will be
interesting to try to ascertain presently how
much he did have out of the old man in the
last year or two.  Three hundred and fifty
pounds in six weeks isn't bad to begin with,
and I don't think there can be any doubt
of his having had that."
</p>

<p>
Assuming Ralph's story to be accurate in
every particular, there yet remained one
point which puzzled Mr. Tracy.  If Sir
Geoffrey had resented Melville's fraud in the
matter of the alleged loan to his brother so
hotly as to be within an ace of prosecuting
him for getting money under false pretences,
why had he relented so suddenly and given
unquestioning hospitality to an extravagant
gambler and swindler whom, even prior to
the last fraud, he had formally discarded and
renounced?  What was the method which
Melville's ingenuity had devised to overcome
Sir Geoffrey's expressed determination?  At
present, Mr. Tracy could not conjecture, but
already he knew enough to make him want
to know more, and in journeying, as he was
now doing, to see what manner of place The
Vale, South Kensington, might be, he was
acting on reason rather than impulse, albeit
the reason was hard to define precisely.
</p>

<p>
At the station he descended from the
omnibus and walked into the Fulham Road,
finding it necessary to ask more than once
where The Vale was to be found; it is, indeed,
not an easy spot to discover, although the
ground occupied by the several houses and
their gardens is so considerable.  Just as he
had lighted upon the archway forming the
entrance to the place, an empty carriage
emerged, and Mr. Tracy asked the coachman
if he knew which was Mrs. Sinclair's house.
</p>

<p>
"Number five," the man replied.  "I was
to have driven her out to-day, but she's ill
and can't go."
</p>

<p>
"Are you her coachman?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," the man said.  "Mrs. Sinclair
doesn't keep a carriage, but hires pretty
often from our place."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Mr. Tracy; "perhaps
I had better postpone my visit to another
day," and, noting with admiration the shady
lawns and bright gardens lurking so
unexpectedly in this busy part of the town, he
turned again into the street, after making
sure that he could find the place again
without difficulty.  A dairy on the other
side of the road, looking delightfully clean
and cool with its green and white tiles,
polished marble counters, and gleaming milk
cans, invited him, and sitting down at a
little table he ordered a large glass of milk
and soda, and drew the girl behind the
counter into a gossipy conversation.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's a sweetly pretty place," she
said, referring to The Vale, "and nice people
live there; carriage people mostly.  We
serve them all."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know Mrs. Sinclair?" Mr. Tracy
asked.  "I was calling upon her to-day, but
am told she isn't well."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," said the girl.  "Oh, yes, I
know her very well.  She is so nice and
civil-spoken, and always so beautifully dressed.
Don't you think she's very good-looking?
Not pretty, you know, but handsome and
distinguished looking."
</p>

<p>
"I haven't seen her for some years,"
Mr. Tracy answered, "but still I daresay she
hasn't changed much.  Women can always
remain any age they please."
</p>

<p>
The girl smiled, as in duty bound.
</p>

<p>
"I always envy Mrs. Sinclair," she said.
"She has everything a woman can possibly
want&mdash;except, perhaps, a husband."
</p>

<p>
So there was no Mr. Sinclair.  Possibly
Jervis was right, and Melville hoped to make
good the want in this lady's scheme of things.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think a rich widow's is really
the happiest lot of all?" Mr. Tracy enquired.
</p>

<p>
"Depends upon the husband, I should
say," the girl replied; "but Mrs. Sinclair is
going to have a husband again."
</p>

<p>
"Is she?" said Mr. Tracy.  "Gad, I'm
glad I got wind of the fact before seeing her.
Women never forgive you if you don't know
that sort of thing, do they?  Who's the
happy man?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, he's not much of a man," the girl
replied, with some disdain, "but he's got a
title, and heaps and heaps of money, so
perhaps the other doesn't matter, specially
to a lady who has been married before.  You
can't expect to be in love twice in one life,
can you?" and she heaved a prodigious sigh
as she thought of her own first ardent passion,
still burning brightly.
</p>

<p>
"Not much of a man, isn't he?" said Mr. Tracy,
amused.  "What sort of a title has
he by way of compensation?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know exactly what he is," she
answered, "but his wife will be My Lady,
anyhow.  She's engaged to Sir Ross Buchanan.
Do you know him?"
</p>

<p>
"I know of him, of course," the lawyer
said, "but I never met him.  He's one of
the richest men in the three kingdoms."
</p>

<p>
"Is he?" said the girl, with awe and
admiration.  "Well, there's no end to some
people's good luck."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tracy paid for his refreshment, and
awaited an omnibus which should take him
to the less savoury purlieus of the law.
</p>

<p>
"A remarkably good day's work," he said.
"I must devise some excuse for calling upon
the fascinating widow, if only out of curiosity.
Anyhow, it isn't matrimony that she is
contemplating with Melville Ashley.  Sir Ross
Buchanan stops the way."
</p>

<p>
But if his enquiries that day opened his
eyes to the possibility of Melville having less
ground of complaint against Sir Geoffrey
than he had hitherto supposed, his investigation
into the financial transactions that had
taken place between them surprised him still
more that night.  He went carefully through
Sir Geoffrey's bank books, and comparing
the entries therein with the counterfoils of
the cheques and the neatly docketed receipts
in Sir Geoffrey's writing table drawers,
worked out a little sum in addition that
astonished him beyond expression.  The
cheques to tradesmen marked "a/c M.A.,"
the details in the various accounts, and the
individual cheques made payable to Melville,
amounted to a total quite appalling to so
simple-minded a man as this old-fashioned
solicitor.  If he had been inclined at first to
think that Ralph exaggerated in his
description of Melville's extravagance, he now
had evidence more than sufficient to prove
that such was not the case.  No terms were
too strong to condemn Melville's wanton and
wicked waste of money; no further reason
was required to explain why he had been
disinherited by his too long-suffering uncle
and guardian.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tracy sat up late that night revolving
the whole matter in his mind, and when at
last he went to bed it was with the firm
determination of having a personal interview
with Mrs. Sinclair on the very first
opportunity.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br><br>
SIR ROSS IS QUITS.
</h3>

<p>
For some little time, however, no opportunity
arose, and Mr. Tracy was, in addition,
conscious of a certain diffidence in calling upon
a lady to whom he was utterly unknown,
simply with the object of making a fishing
enquiry into the manners and morals of one
of her friends.  Melville wrote him a polite
note, expressing regret at having missed him,
and privately gave Jervis a wigging for
allowing anybody to have the run of his rooms
for a couple of hours.  He could not, however,
display great anger, and the effect of what
he did say was only to seal Jervis's lips as to
the conversation that had passed between
Mr. Tracy and himself.  Moreover, it was
so reasonable that Mr. Tracy should call upon
him in the immediate circumstances that
Melville scented no danger, and continued
in a peaceful and equable frame of mind.
</p>

<p>
It was a disturbing fact that Ralph should
not have been acquitted, but there was,
undoubtedly, some compensating advantage
to be derived from it, inasmuch as if the
evidence was so strong against him it was so
much the less probable that any would be
diverted to the real criminal, and Melville
still consoled himself with the reflection that
his brother would certainly be acquitted next
time.  Actually, it worried him scarcely at
all, and to his brother's discomfort and
anxiety he was quite callous.
</p>

<p>
Upon Lavender, on the contrary, the idea
of an innocent man being in such dire peril
had an effect quite paralysing.  Fear of
discovery as Lady Holt was eclipsed by fear
for Ralph, and she would have risked all, so
far as she alone was concerned, if only so
she could have set Ralph free.  But Melville
acquired an influence over her against which
she was unable to rebel; it was not only
the influence exerted through his own
personal magnetism, undeniable as that was;
he did not shrink now from working on her
over-wrought nerves to reduce her to a state
of physical and mental prostration, in which
he could mould her entirely to his will.  He
even conveyed to her an impression that
under desperation he might become
dangerous, and more than once there was a look
in his eyes that frightened her.  Thus, under
the pressure of these combined emotions&mdash;horror
of what she had seen, fear of Melville,
apprehension for Ralph, and anxiety about
her own future&mdash;Lavender became a wreck.
Unable to sleep, she dosed herself with
narcotics to numb her sensibilities, and unused
to the narcotics she grew ill and a shadow
of her former self.  At night she lay awake
in fear of the silence, and by day she kept
awake in fear of every sound.  To the few
casual acquaintances who called she was not
at home, although her prolonged solitude
was prolonged misery.  Yet she could not
make up her mind to do what Melville
persistently advised, and go abroad until the
crime and the mystery of Sir Geoffrey's will
ceased to occupy public attention.
</p>

<p>
Lucille attributed her mistress's illness only
to dread of prosecution for bigamy, and more
than once attempted to reassure her.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't choose to answer the
advertisement," she said, "there's nobody to
answer it for you; and as for this reward
that's offered now, you say that nobody but
me knows you ever were Sir Geoffrey Holt's
wife.  What's two hundred and fifty pounds
compared to a home where a person feels
she's liked, besides being well paid and
comfortable?  Of course, if you can't trust me,
there's no more to be said."
</p>

<p>
Then Lavender would protest that she had
every confidence in her maid's devotion,
and for a few minutes would be less hysterical;
but the greater evil, of which Lucille had no
knowledge, was too great for the improvement
to be maintained, and with each re-action
Lavender's condition grew more deplorable.
</p>

<p>
As ill-luck would have it, Mr. Tracy made
up his mind to call one day when, Lavender
being in rather better spirits, Lucille had
gone out for a couple of hours.  In answer to
his ring, the door was opened by the cook
who was by no means well versed in the art
of admitting or of getting rid of visitors.
She declared, it is true, that Mrs Sinclair
was not at home, but something in the manner
of her declaration induced Mr. Tracy to
persist, with the result that he effected an
entrance into the drawing-room, while the
woman took his card upstairs to see if her
mistress would make an exception in his
favour and receive him.
</p>

<p>
Lavender read his name with sickening
terror, and the expression on her face alarmed
the cook.
</p>

<p>
"The gentleman said he was a friend of
Mr. Ashley's," she explained in self-defence
"and wanted to see you on business.  He
wouldn't take 'no' for an answer."
</p>

<p>
Lavender tried to pull herself together.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know the man from Adam," she
said, "and I feel much too ill to see anybody
on business.  Go down and say I am sorry
but I can't see anyone.  Tell him I've been
ill.  Tell him anything you like.  Only get
rid of him."
</p>

<p>
And when the cook went reluctantly downstairs,
Lavender stood with blanched cheeks
and beating heart by the window, counting
the ticks of the clock until this awful visitant
should go.  Hiding behind the curtains she
watched him walk slowly down the path, and
some time after he had disappeared she
remained with hands clenched upon the back
of a chair, watching with nervous apprehension
in case he should return and make another
attempt to see her.  She showed his card to
Lucille on her return.
</p>

<p>
"It can only mean that he suspects that
Mrs. Sinclair and Lady Holt are one and the
same person," she said despairingly.  "It is
the end of everything," and her hysterical
collapse was pitiful to witness.
</p>

<p>
That first visit, indeed, marked a point
when Lavender's illness became serious.  She
refused to see a doctor, and this refusal
Lucille made no great effort to combat,
knowing that freedom from worry and plenty
of rest were all that were necessary to restore
her mistress to health, and that although
any physician might prescribe these two
remedies, no one could provide them.  For
the present, therefore, the faithful woman
contented herself with never leaving Lavender,
and with taking control of the establishment
in a manner that was as effective as it was
silent and undemonstrative.
</p>

<p>
When next Mr. Tracy presented himself at
The Vale, Lucille received him.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Sinclair is really very ill," she said,
"and unable to see anybody; but more
than that, she told me the other day that
she did not know your name and would not
see you on business without knowing
something about it beforehand.  If you like to
write to her, I daresay she will make an
appointment to see you when she comes back."
</p>

<p>
"Comes back?" said Mr. Tracy.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Lucille replied; "from abroad.
She goes to-morrow, if she's well enough,
but she will certainly go this week."
</p>

<p>
And Mr. Tracy had nothing left but to
murmur some polite good wishes for her complete
restoration to health, and go away again.
</p>

<p>
"The good lady is determined to avoid
me," he thought.  "Well, it can't be helped.
The clock won't stop for poor Ralph Ashley
because Mrs. Sinclair wants to go abroad,
and I am determined to get to the bottom
of all I don't know about the family before
it is too late.  Mrs. Sinclair has reasons,
either of her own or of Melville Ashley's, for
not wanting to see me.  Perhaps her <i>fiancé</i>
will be more accommodating.  I will beard
the bold Sir Ross in his den."
</p>

<p>
Without further delay he set about the
business.  Sir Ross was in the habit of
standing much upon his dignity, and felt
inclined at first to refuse admission to this
stranger who presented himself at his door
without any previous advertisement of his
coming; but his curiosity was aroused by
the message that the stranger desired to see
him in connection with Melville Ashley.
Whether Sir Ross scented a battle from afar,
or whether it was a less heroic form of curiosity,
does not matter much; at all events, he
acceded to Mr. Tracy's request for an audience,
and with the proud air of a man who is not
only a millionaire but a patrician, he entered
the room where his visitor was awaiting him.
With a magnificent gesture he motioned him
to a seat.
</p>

<p>
"You are&mdash;er?" was his intelligent enquiry.
</p>

<p>
"I am the family solicitor to the Ashleys
and to the late Sir Geoffrey Holt," said
Mr. Tracy, "and I am very anxious to enlist
your help in a matter of considerable delicacy.
May I throw myself upon your mercy, Sir
Ross, and beg you to help me, if you can?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall be glad if I can be of any assistance,"
said Sir Ross stiffly, "but I quite fail
to see how it is likely that I can be.  Is it
in connection with the murder that you
think I may be of use?  Sir Geoffrey
was&mdash;er&mdash;one of us."
</p>

<p>
"Not perhaps directly in connection with
the murder," Mr. Tracy replied, "but there
are several things in the story which are
puzzling.  What more natural than that I
should come to a man of the world like
yourself and say, 'I have no right to trouble
you with my difficulties it is true, but of your
charity help me from your superior knowledge
of men and of affairs?'"
</p>

<p>
Sir Ross concealed his delight with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
"But why choose me?  There are other
men of the world whose names, I should have
thought, would have suggested themselves
more naturally."
</p>

<p>
"I had one primary object in venturing
to come to you first," Mr. Tracy answered.
"Sir Ross, I am speaking as if in the
confessional?"  Sir Ross bowed.  "Well, then,
I want you to tell me what you know of
Mr. Melville Ashley."
</p>

<p>
The slowly dawning look of cordiality
died again from the little baronet's face, and
his dignity was icy.
</p>

<p>
"I know&mdash;and I desire to know&mdash;practically
nothing at all about Mr. Melville
Ashley."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tracy hastened to explain.
</p>

<p>
"As I said just now, I throw myself upon
your mercy.  My visit may seem an impertinent
intrusion, but it is not prompted in
any degree by love or regard for Mr. Melville
Ashley."  He proceeded to explain how he
had been led to make some enquiries into
that individual's mode of life, and with what
result.  "You know everybody, Sir Ross.
Is it common knowledge that Mr. Ashley
plays high?"
</p>

<p>
"The first time I ever saw him was at
Monte Carlo," Sir Ross replied, "and on that
occasion he took advantage of the <i>viaticum</i> to
get home, so he played, at any rate, until
he had nothing left to play with.  Over here
I don't know much about him personally,
but I could not afford the points which his
set affect."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tracy shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks; that is quite enough for my
purpose.  The fact is, I was at a loss to
account for various sums of money which
have passed through his hands, and the
cards seemed the only possible explanation.
I don't think he drinks or has other vices."
</p>

<p>
"Gamblers never do drink," said Sir Ross
vindictively; "they press the liquor on the
other side.  Frankly, Mr. Tracy, I think
Mr. Melville Ashley is the devil incarnate, and I
should never be surprised to hear any villainy
of him."
</p>

<p>
The vigour with which the little man
delivered himself of this outburst surprised
the lawyer considerably, but he trimmed
with superlative skill.
</p>

<p>
"He is one of those curious people who
lead several different lives simultaneously.
In my capacity of Sir Geoffrey Holt's executor
I wanted to ascertain why his uncle
disinherited him&mdash;which he has done&mdash;in order
that I might know how far to encourage
or restrain his brother's impulse to make
provision for him by deed of gift."
</p>

<p>
"What's the brother like?" enquired Sir Ross.
</p>

<p>
"A fine fellow," said Mr. Tracy warmly;
"white all through.  As different from
Melville as it's possible to imagine."
</p>

<p>
"Must be," grunted Sir Ross.  "If it
weren't that you say he's been cut off without
a shilling, I should say that Mr. Melville
Ashley shot his uncle and shifted the suspicion
on to his brother by some vile trickery."  He
paused a minute, and then in his turn
sought the information which he had failed
to obtain elsewhere.  "You are the family
lawyer, so you will probably be able to tell
me this.  What is the relationship between
Mr. Ashley and Mrs. Sinclair?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean the Mrs. Sinclair to whom
you are engaged?"
</p>

<p>
"To whom I was engaged," said Sir Ross,
flushing; "that is whom I mean.  I am
told there is some relationship by marriage
between her and the Ashleys.  What is it
precisely?"
</p>

<p>
"I am not aware of any," said Mr. Tracy,
feeling horribly uncomfortable.  "I know
they are acquainted."
</p>

<p>
"I knew Mr. Sinclair intimately," said Sir
Ross, "but I never heard of any relations of
his named Ashley; yet when I had occasion
to object to Mr. Melville Ashley's very
constant attendance on and very marked
attentions to Mrs. Sinclair, an attempt was made
to over-rule my protest on the ground that
they were so closely related by marriage that
my objections were absurd.  What is the
relationship?"
</p>

<p>
"Really you embarrass me very much,"
said Mr. Tracy pathetically.  "If Mr. Ashley
alone had alleged it I should have said he
was mistaken, but if the lady corroborated
it there must be something in it, although
it is news to me."
</p>

<p>
"There was so much in it," said Sir Ross,
with fine sarcasm, "that I required the lady
to choose between us, and as she declined to
give Mr. Ashley his <i>congé</i> I retired from the
apparent rivalry with a person whom I detest,
and my engagement to Mrs. Sinclair is
cancelled."
</p>

<p>
"Not many women are so unmercenary,"
Mr. Tracy replied, "and not many men get
such proof of having been loved for
themselves alone and not for their wealth and
position."
</p>

<p>
He meant the remark to be in the nature of
an emollient, but it failed to have that effect.
</p>

<p>
"I am not sufficiently sentimental to
appreciate the value of being loved for myself
alone," Sir Ross responded drily, "if the
upshot is that I am to be jilted for somebody
else.  The essential thing is that I, although
one of Mr. Sinclair's intimate friends, have
never heard of any relationship between his
family and Mr. Ashley's; neither have you,
although you are the solicitor to Mr. Ashley's
family.  It merely corroborates my previous
impression that the alleged relationship is all
my eye."
</p>

<p>
He blew out his cheeks, which were purple
with just indignation at the recollection of
the affront offered to his intelligence, and
glared fiercely at Mr. Tracy, who represented
his hated rival's house; but Mr. Tracy
remained as gentle and unmoved as ever.
</p>

<p>
"I am unable to explain, Sir Ross.  I have
never met the lady, nor indeed heard of her
except as your future wife.  What is she like?"
</p>

<p>
Sir Ross looked round the room; the
photographs of Lavender, which once were
numerous, had been removed immediately
after the rupture of the engagement, and he
had to open a bureau in a corner to find some.
There, however, he found plenty, framed
and unframed.
</p>

<p>
"There she is," he said, and heaved a
sigh as he saw the counterfeit presentment
of her superb womanhood.
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Tracy's forehead was all wrinkled
and his eyebrows were drawn together as he
stared at the photographs and tried to fix
in his memory where he had met this woman,
and under what cognomen; it must be long
ago, and yet the face was familiar to him.
At last his mind responded to the effort, and
putting his hand into his inner pocket he
withdrew a letter-case, and opening it
produced the photograph of the unknown lady
which Gwendolen had given to him at Fairbridge.
He laid it on the table by the others,
and motioned to Sir Ross to examine it.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that must be an early photograph
of Mrs. Sinclair," the baronet exclaimed.
"How do you come by that?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tracy hesitated to disclose the chain
of his thoughts.  To do so might cause much
pain to the worthy little Scotchman, who,
at least, had been sincere in his affection for
this woman, and Mr. Tracy shrank from
doing that.  Yet, so much might be at
stake!
</p>

<p>
"It looks like an extraordinary freak of
fortune, but of course I may be wrong.  I
found that photograph among a lot of papers,
and did not know whose likeness it was.
You are sure it is Mrs. Sinclair?"
</p>

<p>
"Morally certain," said Sir Ross.  "What
does it all mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Possibly nothing," Mr. Tracy answered;
"possibly a great deal, including an explanation
of that alleged relationship.  You can
help me more than I thought, though, perhaps,
at the cost of suffering to yourself.  I believe
that this is a picture of Sir Geoffrey's widow,
Dame Lavinia Holt.  If I am right, it will
prove at least that Mr. Melville Ashley has
committed perjury in one important
particular, and it may prove God knows what
else."
</p>

<p>
"What else?" thundered Sir Ross.  "That
Mrs. Sinclair shot Sir Geoffrey Holt?"
</p>

<p>
"The Lord forbid!" said Mr. Tracy very
earnestly; "but I have to rescue an innocent
man.  Whoever did that murder, it was not
Ralph Ashley, as I mean to make clear before
the world.  If I can prove that this"&mdash;and
he laid his hand upon the portrait found by
Gwendolen&mdash;"is a picture of Lady Holt, I
can save my man.  That done, I'll gladly
leave the rest to God and to the Crown."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV.
<br><br>
MRS. SINCLAIR RESOLVES TO GO AWAY.
</h3>

<p>
Lavender never ceased to regret the impulse
which had prompted her to persuade Melville
to let her accompany him on that fateful
visit to Fairbridge.  Missing the constant
attendance of him and of Sir Ross Buchanan,
after their unfortunate meeting in her drawing
room, she became bored with her own society,
and was really only influenced by that, and
perhaps by some little idle curiosity, when
she called upon him at Jermyn Street and
induced him to give her the innocent pleasure
of a picnic up the river.  It seemed too cruel
that her simple want of something definite
to do on that one day of her life should have
involved her in such an appalling catastrophe.
She had never known a moment's peace or
happiness since then.  Had it not been for
her lack of occupation and for her natural
terror of the thunderstorm, she would not
have gone to the Manor House at all, would
not have been a witness of the tragedy,
would not have had this burden on her soul.
Were it not for her knowledge whose hand
took Sir Geoffrey's life she could have faced
the world with a clear conscience on the
subject of that crime, could have awaited
the issue of Ralph's trial with comparative
equanimity, and have received Melville with
no reservation of mistrust or horror of the
blood upon his hands.
</p>

<p>
That single impulse had rendered this
impossible.  She did know who the real
criminal was, did know that it was an innocent
man upon whom suspicion had fallen, did
know the injustice of it all; and yet her
lips were sealed and she was dumb.  From
the moment of Ralph's arrest until the
moment at the assizes when the jury failed
to agree upon a verdict, she had remained
in London, unable to tear herself away from
the dreadful fascination of his danger.  She
had confidently anticipated his acquittal, and
the relief she would have experienced at
knowing that an innocent man would not
suffer death, would have been the saving of
her own life and reason.  But although she
had endured the torments of suspense so
long, her strength was exhausted and she
could endure no more.  If, next time, Ralph
were convicted, Lavender felt sure that the
horror of his impending doom would drive
her mad.  It was better if he had to die that
she should not know it, should only learn of
it long after it had happened.  She must go
away, and at once.
</p>

<p>
That was the conclusion at which she
arrived immediately after the abortive trial,
and Mr. Tracy's visits to The Vale only
confirmed her resolution.  She was satisfied that
his object in calling was to identify her as
Lady Holt, and that identification only
meant the substitution of one disaster for
another.  So, after his second visit, she
determined to do what her maid had professed
she was upon the point of doing, and
leave for the Continent that week.  Had it
not been for the necessity of seeing Melville,
she would have made an effort to start the
following day, but she could not leave
without making some arrangement with him for
the communication of urgent news, and this
involved the settlement of some definite route
to which she must adhere, and also the
invention of some code, under the seeming
innocence of which the most startling
information might be sent to her without
attracting attention.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, houses cannot be casually left in
London, unless, perhaps, by the very rich,
who have servants to whose care they can
entrust everything just as it is at any moment;
and Lavender had all the house-pride and
affection for her goods and chattels that
makes English home life so indicative of
English character.  Having decided to go
away, she set about doing the thousand
things that must be done ere she could lock
all the doors and windows, and abandon her
house to the formal custody of the caretaker.
</p>

<p>
She stood in the drawing-room buttoning
her gloves, and looked around her.  All the
silver ornaments, the ivories and needlework
were put away, and the place wore a
cheerless look.  She would be glad when the
morrow came and she turned her back upon
it for an indefinite time.  If only she could
leave her misery behind as well, with what a
different feeling she would start upon her
journey!  But that could not be; only
death could bring her that emancipation.
</p>

<p>
Leaving Lucille upstairs to finish packing,
Lavender went round to the tradesmen to
pay their several books and give instructions
that they should not call for orders until they
heard from her again.  She completed her
round of visits with an odd sense of having
come to the end of a period in her existence,
and was walking listlessly homewards, when
the thought struck her that she must lose
no time if she wanted to be sure of conveying
a message to Melville before he left home, as
she knew he generally did after his mid-day
meal.  It was to be a verbal message, given
by Lucille to him in person, and it must be
carefully worded, so as to arouse no
speculations in the servant's mind.  She walked
briskly back and called Lucille.
</p>

<p>
"I want you to go to Jermyn Street at
once," she said, "and take a message to
Mr. Ashley.  His chambers are on the top floor,
and you can go up to his door without telling
the hall porter whose rooms you are going
to.  Say you must see him himself, and
when you do, give him my compliments, say
I am going abroad to-morrow, and ask him
if he will take me out to dinner to-night,
and tell you where and when I shall meet him."
</p>

<p>
"And if he isn't in?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't deliver the message to anybody
but Mr. Ashley.  If he isn't in you must go
again later on, but you will see him if you
go now.  Take a cab, so as to make sure."
</p>

<p>
Inwardly Lucille was a little surprised,
for she had seen much less of Melville lately,
and hoped that his great intimacy with
Lavender was diminishing.  She looked
forward to a time when Sir Ross Buchanan
would pick up the dropped threads of his
courtship and draw her mistress into a safe
haven of matrimony, from which Mr. Ashley,
with all other disturbing influences, would be
permanently excluded.  That very morning,
when packing, she had hesitated as to whether
she should or should not put into one of the
portmanteaux the large silver-framed
photograph of the little baronet, which always
stood on Lavender's dressing-table, and she
had only decided not to do so because on
this occasion she was anxious to take nothing
which might remind her mistress of the
immediate past.  But of all this the good
creature made no sign.  She donned her hat
and gloves, and, selecting a hansom with a
likely-looking horse, soon arrived at Jermyn
Street.
</p>

<p>
Acting upon her mistress's instructions,
she walked upstairs and knocked at Melville's
door.  It was opened by Jervis, who looked
at her approvingly.
</p>

<p>
"Is Mr. Ashley at home?" she enquired.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Jervis.  "What name shall I say?"
</p>

<p>
Lucille hesitated; it might be advisable
not to mention her mistress's name to the
valet, and her own surname was not known
to Melville.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Lucille," she said at last, and Jervis
smiled.
</p>

<p>
"French," he thought.  "Query, French
maid.  Gad, I'm beginning to think I gave
Mr. Ashley a false character to the family
lawyer, and that the circle of his female
acquaintances is larger than I thought."  He
invited Lucille to walk in, and bestowing
upon her another smile of cordiality and
approval, of which she took no notice
whatever, went into the bedroom where Melville
was dressing.
</p>

<p>
"A lady to see you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"A what?" said Melville, looking at the
clock; an odd time, he thought, forgetting
for the moment, with characteristic casualness,
the urgent reasons several women might
have for ringing him up at any time.  "Who
is she?  What does she want?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't know, sir," Jervis replied; "haven't
seen her before; gave the name of Lucille&mdash;Miss
Lucille."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! ah! of course," said Melville quickly.
"That's all right.  Tell her I'll come in a
minute, and then I shan't want you."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir," said Jervis, and giving
the message to Lucille, he left the flat, and,
substituting a smart coat for his linen jacket,
he arranged himself upon the staircase to
await Lucille's reappearance, holding a feather
brush in his hand to avoid any air of being
out of work.
</p>

<p>
Lucille criticised the room in which she
was, and sniffed.
</p>

<p>
"Ladylike," she remarked, and the epithet
was a happy one.  The open piano, the
violins, and a basket-tray of cut flowers,
just delivered by a neighbouring florist, gave
an impression that the occupant of the flat
was a woman rather than a man.  She rose
as Melville entered.
</p>

<p>
"Your mistress has sent me a message?"
he said curtly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir!" she answered.  "She desired
me to give you her compliments and say
that she is leaving for the Continent
tomorrow, and to ask whether you could take
her out to dinner this evening."
</p>

<p>
Melville frowned; he had an appointment
for the evening which he was unwilling to
cancel, but experience had shown him that
Lavender would not trouble him unnecessarily,
and if she was at last about to gratify
him by going out of the country, she deserved
this small gratification in return.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be delighted," he said, without a
spark of enthusiasm.  "Am I to come to The
Vale?"
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Sinclair said if you would tell me
where you thought of dining, and at what
time, she would meet you at the place,"
Lucille replied.  "Her house is all dismantled,
as she starts early to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so," said Melville.  "Well, ask her
to join me at the Café d'Autriche in Pall Mall
at a quarter to seven.  Do you think that
will be too early for her?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," said Lucille.  "I daresay
she will prefer not to be home late."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Melville, and as he held
open the door for her to pass out, Lucille
could not fail, much as she disliked the man,
to be conscious of his fascination of manner
and perfect breeding.
</p>

<p>
Jervis stood on the next landing and waved
his feather brush in the direction of the lift.
</p>

<p>
"Mayn't I take you down in the lift,
Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Lucille?" he suggested amiably.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, no," she answered; "I don't like
elevators."
</p>

<p>
"Elevators?" said Jervis.  "Are you
American?  I made sure you were French."
</p>

<p>
"Did you?" Lucille remarked, withholding
information on the point, but an amused look
on her face belied the coldness of her tone.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," Jervis persisted, "where do
you live, Miss Lucille?"
</p>

<p>
"Geneva, when I'm at home," she answered.
</p>

<p>
"A perfect cosmopolitan," said Jervis,
with admiration.  "French name, American
language, and Swiss home.  I suppose you
would not care to be English by marriage,
would you?"
</p>

<p>
"Is that an offer?" Lucille enquired,
looking at him so frigidly that his genial
smile was frozen on his face.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he stammered, "I am engaged,
you know, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Poor girl!" said Lucille, and continued
her progress downstairs, leaving the valet
short of repartee.  He flung the feather
brush down in the passage, and returned
disconsolately to Melville's rooms.
</p>

<p>
Melville stood with his hands thrust deep
into his pockets, thinking hard.  He had been
counting out his money that morning, and
the operation took a disgustingly short time
in the doing; he had a balance of thirty-seven
pounds in the bank, and a five-pound
note, three sovereigns and some silver in his
rooms: a total of something under forty-six
pounds left from Mr. Tracy's little payment
on account of out-of-pocket expenses
on Ralph's behalf.  The result of the
expenditure of the other fifty-four pounds was
difficult to define, but if it did not benefit
Ralph it benefited Melville as little.  They
were gone, though whither Melville had no
clear notion.  Mr. Tracy might be good for
another hundred later on, but certainly not
at once.  The evening engagement which,
by arranging to dine early, Melville did not
find it necessary to cancel, might result in an
addition to his funds, for its primary object
was cards, but, on the other hand, it might
not.  The barometer of his luck had fluctuated
from fair to stormy of late.  Where
should he go for an appreciable sum&mdash;if not
to Lavender?  And why not to Lavender?
The necessity had arisen sooner than he
anticipated, but from the first he had seen
her potentialities as a source of revenue for
himself, and he had no squeamish reluctance
in availing himself of any means of assistance
which fortune dropped in his way.  The
opportunity of asking her was created by
herself, and, in view of her departure from
England, might not arise again.
</p>

<p>
He wrote an open cheque for thirty pounds
and called Jervis.
</p>

<p>
"Go round to my bank and cash that
cheque for me.  Take it in five-pound notes;
I have enough change on me."
</p>

<p>
And when Jervis presently returned, Melville
put the banknotes in his writing table
drawer, lighted a cigarette, and went out for
his usual gentle constitutional in the streets
frequented by the best sort of idle man-about-town,
as calm and free from worry as the
idlest of them all.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV.
<br><br>
MRS. SINCLAIR GOES AWAY.
</h3>

<p>
The pleasant anticipation of her trip abroad,
and the little mild excitement promised by
her prospective dinner at a restaurant, among
well-dressed people and brightened by lights
and music, went far to rouse Lavender from
her recent long spell of depression; there
was much of the old sparkle in her eyes,
much of the warm colour in her cheeks, as
she finished dressing that evening and looked
at her reflection in the mirrors while waiting
for Lucille to bring her opera cloak.
</p>

<p>
Some caprice impelled her to desire to look
her very best to-night, and she was magnificently
dressed in champagne <i>crepe-de-chine</i>,
worn over a foundation the tint of
apricots.  Regardless of the general
superstition she had chosen opals for her jewels,
and they burned in a myriad fantastic colours
upon her splendid neck and bosom, and crept
like a flaming serpent up one of her finely
moulded arms.  Few women could wear
magnificent gems as easily as Lavender Sinclair,
and, imperial as she looked to-night, there
was no suggestion of ostentation or of bad
taste in her appearance.  Here was the
splendour that compels homage, not the
lavish display that challenges criticism.
</p>

<p>
Lucille surveyed her with proud affection
ere she dropped the long opera cloak lightly
over her shoulders, screening the glowing
opals and covering the delicate gown.  There
was no need for Lavender to ask if she looked
well; the least vain woman in the world,
the most vain one as well, would have been
satisfied by one glance at the image reflected
from the depths of the full-length mirrors.
Reluctantly Lucille extinguished the candles
that stood in branching candelabra over the
mirrors, and went downstairs to unroll the
carpet from the hall door to the gate, where
the hansom stood in readiness.
</p>

<p>
Lavender stood in the doorway and looked
at the fair exterior of the small domain where
for the last five years she had led so luxurious
an existence.  The sound of the traffic
outside was subdued in here, and The Vale was
like a green island in the great river of London
life; all of the houses were creeper-covered,
and in the flower-beds in the lawns were
brilliant geraniums and petunias and giant
sunflowers.  Lavender's own garden was as
pretty as any of them, with ribbon grass and
flaunting lilies, and a gnarled wistaria
stretching brown arms over the porch.  It seemed a
pity to be leaving home when it was all so
sweet and dainty, and yet August had never
before found her in London.
</p>

<p>
She got into the cab, and, smiling a farewell
to Lucille, told the man to drive to the Café
d'Autriche.  It was a lovely evening, and
already, early as it was, the stream of cabs
and carriages was setting in the direction of
the great hotels and restaurants.  Lavender
leaned back in her seat and watched the
familiar scene with the keen interest of the
intelligent Londoner, but as she travelled
along the Brompton Road a wistful look
stole over her face.  Good as her lot had
been until these later days, it might have
been better still if as a child she had been
taught more self-control.  If Sir Geoffrey
had been more patient with his impetuous
child-wife, and she herself had been less
self-willed and passionate, she might now be
driving through the town, not as a practical
adventuress masquerading under a name to
which she had no right, but as the wife of an
honoured and honourable old man&mdash;not as a
supposititious Mrs. Sinclair, but in her true
guise as Lady Holt.
</p>

<p>
They had got nearly to the end of the road
when suddenly, with a deafening rattle and
clanking of chains and a throbbing pulsation
of machinery, a heavy traction engine, drawing
a trolly laden with an enormous cylindrical
boiler, came panting towards them.  At the
same moment the horses attached to an
omnibus, between which and the pavement
Lavender's cab was passing, shied and swerved,
the axle of the hind wheel forcing the cab
against the curb.  Startled by the slight
collision, and terrified by the hammering
din of the ungainly locomotive, the animal
behind which Lavender was sitting&mdash;a wiry
Irish mare&mdash;threw back her ears, and, letting
fly with her heels at the splash-board, dashed
madly forward, jerking the bit between her
teeth and getting absolutely out of hand.
</p>

<p>
A spasm of fear gripped Lavender's heart,
and then, sitting bolt upright with hands
pressed against the two sides of the cab, she
braced herself to await the catastrophe.
Even in the wild rush of the moment she
noted with admiration how the driver
managed to keep some semblance of control
over the terrified mare, guiding her, he
certainly knew not how, past cabs and
omnibuses.  But foolish people on the pavement
began to shout, and only scared the little
mare into a wilder pace.  Crossing the top of
Sloane Street they avoided by a hair's
breadth a green omnibus full of people, and
raced on towards the huge Hyde Park Hotel;
they skidded over the edge of the island in
the road, but already the cab was swaying
from side to side with a rhythmical swing
that grew more dangerous every time, and
in Lavender's mind two words kept ringing in
rhythm with the swinging of the cab, Lavender
Holt&mdash;Lavender Holt&mdash;Lavender Holt.
</p>

<p>
She was kept in no suspense as to what
the end would be, but even her stout heart
quailed as she saw in what shape death was
coming to her.  Just by the railings of the
Park the road was up, and policemen were
diverting the traffic on to the other side of
the road; but now the mare was blind and
deaf and mad, only struggling to get faster
and farther away from the hellish clangour
of that horrible machine behind.  Lifting
herself together she charged full at the barrier
of stout pines, upsetting a brazier full of
charcoal and crashing anyhow into a maze of
broken poles and blocks of karri-karri.
</p>

<p>
The impact threw the driver clear over the
cab and forced Lavender through the window
folded up above her.  Shivering glass and
splintering wood tore and rent their way
into her face and neck and hands; one sob
escaped her as a blaze of red flashed up before
her to die away in utter hopeless blackness,
and she was lying crushed and bleeding in
the wreckage of the cab, as motionless as the
mare that lay dead beside her.
</p>

<p>
There is no city in the world where help
is so speedily forthcoming for the injured as
it is in London.  Almost before the crowd
that ran shouting after the runaway came
up to the spot where the dead mare lay amid
the havoc she had wrought, Lavender and
the cabman were taken to the nearest hospital.
Tender hands took the jewels from her torn
neck and shoulders, unclasped the winking
serpent from her arm, and cut the stained
gown from her broken frame.  Her wounds
were dressed and she was already laid in a
spotless little bed ere she recovered consciousness.
</p>

<p>
"Who is she?" said the house-surgeon.
"Does anybody know?"
</p>

<p>
"There are only initials on her linen,"
one of the nurses said; "perhaps the cabman
may be able to tell us by-and-bye."
</p>

<p>
The house-surgeon shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"'The poor fellow can never tell us
anything now; he was dead before they brought
him in.  This poor creature's hours are
numbered too."  He went out to the
constables who had brought the accident in.
"One of you had better come inside," he
said; "the lady is dying, but she may
recover consciousness before the end," and,
with an inspector of police, he resumed his
seat by the side of the bed.  A quiver moved
the tired eyelids, so faint that only the
surgeon saw it.  He bent over Lavender.
</p>

<p>
"Lavender Holt," she murmured, her dazed
brain reverting to what had been almost her
last conscious thought, and rhythmically the
words forced themselves from the white lips
again and yet again&mdash;"Lavender Holt&mdash;Lavender
Holt."
</p>

<p>
"You are Lavender Holt?" the surgeon
asked, and she made a sign of assent.
</p>

<p>
"Can that be the woman who has been
advertised for from Fairbridge Manor?" the
inspector whispered, an eager light shining in
his eyes; "the missing widow of the murdered man?"
</p>

<p>
The silence was painfully long drawn out,
but again the white lips tried to frame a
name, and this time the inspector's suggestion
helped.
</p>

<p>
"Try Ashley," he murmured, and with
wonderful skill the surgeon encouraged the
wavering brain to act.
</p>

<p>
"You are Lady Holt," he said, "and you
want to see Mr. Ashley, is that it?"
</p>

<p>
A look of relief crossed her face.  It was
enough that her wish was understood, but
too much for her to grasp the fact that there
was any danger for anyone in what the wish
involved.  Behind her vacant look the surgeon
saw the glimmer of consciousness, and with
infinite patience he extracted from her that
it was Melville whom she wished to see, and
that he lived in Jermyn Street.
</p>

<p>
"That is the brother of the suspect," the
inspector whispered.  "You had better send
for him at once," and without any delay a
messenger was despatched in a cab to
Melville's chambers.
</p>

<p>
Before the tiny wave of strength had ebbed,
Lavender found means to ask for Lucille too,
and said that she lived at The Vale, South
Kensington.  That much done, her brain
became clouded again, and for a space the
others could only wait and watch.
</p>

<p>
"She will probably have several periods of
consciousness," the surgeon said to the
inspector, "but there is no chance of life for
her.  If you think that she really is the
widow of Sir Geoffrey Holt, who has been
so sought after of late, perhaps you had better
arrange for her depositions to be taken next
time she comes round."
</p>

<p>
It was half-past eight before Lucille arrived,
and later still before Lavender opened her
eyes again and saw her loyal servant kneeling
near her.  She smiled, contented, but the
worst ordeal was to come.
</p>

<p>
"Melville?" she whispered.
</p>

<p>
"He isn't here," they answered.  "He
said he would come at once, but something
has detained him by the way."
</p>

<p>
Someone stooped over her: a tall, grey
man with kind eyes set in a stern face, and
he was speaking slowly and earnestly, so that
each softly uttered word conveyed its full
meaning.  He told her that the end was very
near; that if she had anything to say the
minutes left in which to say it were but few,
and that if she knew anything about her
husband and his end it was her duty to
reveal it all to man before she faced the
judgment seat of God.
</p>

<p>
"Melville?" she said again, and in this
supreme moment it was only his absence that
distressed her.  He had promised not to
fail her when she should send for him, and
now he was breaking his word because he
could not trust her not to betray him.
</p>

<p>
"You understand?" the grey man said.
"You are going to tell me everything you
know, and I will write it down.  The truth,
dear lady, as before the God who is calling
you away to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Ralph Ashley is innocent," she said, and
by degrees the broken story was told; told
in faint outline, but with sufficient clearness
to make corroboration easy afterwards.  She
told of her early marriage to Sir Geoffrey and
of her flight from him; of her marriage to
Mr. Sinclair, made in all good faith, and of his
death; of her visit to Fairbridge Manor on the
fatal day from idle curiosity to see what
might have been her home; of Sir Geoffrey's
murder by the man with whom she went,
and how she only chanced to be a witness of
it because she was frightened by the storm;
of how she saw the weapon dropped into the
river, and was intimidated into silence
afterwards; how she had always believed that
an innocent man could not be convicted, and
that Ralph would be set free and the true
facts never be known.  She told it all, but
never gave a clue as to who her companion
on that momentous occasion was.
</p>

<p>
On that point she was obdurate.  It was
her duty to prevent the innocent man from
suffering, but she could not be brought to
believe that it was her duty to bring the
guilty one to justice.  That was her code
of morals, and while she was true to
it in this last hour by doing what she
could to set Ralph free, she would not be
false to it by breaking her solemn promise
to Melville.
</p>

<p>
"I'm very tired," she said, and in sheer
compassion they let her be.  She contrived
to affix some sort of signature to the
statement they read over to her, and then the
others withdrew, leaving her to the care of
the nurses and doctors and the company of
Lucille, who loved her so.
</p>

<p>
"Everything I have I've given to you,"
she said once, and later on sent a farewell
message to Sir Ross.  Melville she did not
mention any more; she had kept her promise
and that sufficed.  So she lay, waiting for
the end, with an expression on her face in
which fear had no part.  Warm-hearted and
impulsive, no one could ever tell how much
she may have repented the part she played
in spoiling Sir Geoffrey's life by her early
desertion of him.  From that point onwards,
however, within the limitations of her rather
crude nature, she had always been kind,
straightforward, and true, and death found
her not afraid.  Of many a better woman not
so much can be said.
</p>

<p>
Lucille knelt by her, gently stroking her
hair, grudging every second as it sped.  A
faint smile flickered over Lavender's face,
just lightening the gravity that was settling
on it, and for the last time the lips that had
never spoken an unkind word parted.  Lucille
bent her head nearer and caught the whisper.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye&mdash;dear."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI.
<br><br>
FATE TAKES THE ODD TRICK.
</h3>

<p>
Melville was on the point of leaving his
rooms, his Inverness cape hanging on his
arm, when Jervis came into the room.
</p>

<p>
"A commissionaire, sir, has come and
wants to see you."
</p>

<p>
"All right," said Melville casually; "send
him up."
</p>

<p>
The man appeared and gave his message
tersely; he was often sent on errands such
as this, but still was no adept in the art of
breaking bad news.
</p>

<p>
"There has been an accident, sir, and you
are wanted at once."
</p>

<p>
"Who is hurt?" Melville asked.
</p>

<p>
"Lady Holt," the man replied.
</p>

<p>
"Lady Holt?" said Melville; "and she
sent for me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; the cabman's killed and the
lady's dying, they say.  Will you come back
with me?  I have a cab at the door."
</p>

<p>
"Is it as bad as that?" said Melville.
</p>

<p>
"They're waiting to take her depositions,
if they can," the messenger said.  "It was
an awful sight."
</p>

<p>
"Go back and say I'll come in half a
minute," Melville said.  "I shall be there as
soon as you, if not sooner."
</p>

<p>
He controlled his agitation until the door
closed upon the man, and then, turning the
key in the lock, threw his cape upon the
couch.  In an instant he realised to the full
what this meant.  With incredible swiftness
he slipped off his dress clothes and changed
into a dark mourning suit, crammed some
linen and a couple of suits into a Gladstone
bag, tipped the contents of his despatch box
into it, and took the banknotes from his
writing-table drawer.  In a wonderfully short
time his preparations were complete, and,
grasping the bag, he ran lightly down the
staircase, and getting into the crowd in
Piccadilly Circus took a cab and drove to Charing
Cross.  Finding that he still had some time to
wait before the express left, he went into one
of the many small restaurants near the station
and took a hasty dinner, which he washed
down with a plentiful supply of spirits.
Before suspicion at the hospital had definitely
been turned upon him, he was lying back
against the cushions of an otherwise empty
carriage and speeding through Kent upon
his way to Dover.
</p>

<p>
He did his utmost to concentrate his
thoughts upon what was next to be done,
but, despite his endeavours, they would
wander to the hospital where Lavender was
lying.  If he had any sure information of
what was going on there, what the nature of
the accident was, and who was with her, the
possible danger would have had less terror for
him; but it was still too early for any
particulars to appear in the papers, and he could
only allow his overwrought imagination to
supply the details for him.  The commissionaire
had said that Lady Holt was dying,
and used the ill-omened word "depositions."
That meant that Lavender had acknowledged
her identity either by accident or of design,
and was about to make a full statement of
her knowledge of the events which culminated
in Sir Geoffrey's death.  Doubtless,
she was being influenced by some smooth-cheeked,
smooth-spoken parson to confess her
sins before passing away, and in the hysterical,
neurotic state in which she had been these
last few weeks&mdash;to say nothing of the state
to which the accident might have reduced
her&mdash;that task of professional persuasion
might be only too easy to fulfil.  She had
tied the label of conviction round his neck
by asking for him by name, and while his
flight would possibly only be regarded as
corroboration of her story, the alternative
course of staying was attended by too grave
risks for any sane man to contemplate.  No
good purpose could be served now by hoping
for the best or by trying to look upon the
bright side of things.  It was wiser to look the
probabilities squarely in the face, and they
spelled hanging by the neck for Melville Ashley.
</p>

<p>
As he sat there, rigid and impassive, he
might have been taken for a financier working
out some vast calculation involving millions
of money, a statesman debating a point in
international policy involving issues of peace
or war, a physician considering a new development
of disease involving life or death to his
patient; no one would have taken him for
what he was, a murderer flying from the
Nemesis that was trailing close after him.
But his cold face masked a heart aflame
already.  As on his way home from Monte
Carlo he cursed what he called his luck, so
now on his way from London to&mdash;he knew
not where&mdash;he cursed the greater thing he
called his destiny.
</p>

<p>
Only once could he remember having
made any mistake in the way he played the
cards dealt out to him by fate, and what
added bitterness to the memory now was the
fact that he made the mistake with his eyes
open.  He cursed himself for having once
been persuaded into doing a thing which at
the time he knew was imprudent.  That
once was when he agreed to take Lavender
with him by boat to Fairbridge Manor.  But
for that he would not now be in this parlous
plight.  Even supposing he had still
committed the murder&mdash;which actually was never
in his mind when he set out&mdash;he still would
not have been seen and been rendered subject
to the mercies of an emotional woman.
Lavender would never have suspected him,
and he could have kept his own counsel and
had no fear of nerves.
</p>

<p>
It was impossible for him to keep his mind
from memories and turn it to the future.
He could only think of what had been and
what might have been, not of what was
to be.  Never before had his thinking powers
played him false like this; will and foresight
were dispossessed by memory just at the
moment when he needed them as he had
never needed them before.  That was the
most pregnant fact of all, and he did not
perceive it.  If he thought of the present it
was only with some vague satisfaction that
every moment was taking him farther away
from peril.
</p>

<p>
In the hospital the depositions were taken,
and the grey man looked across at the
inspector of police and left the room with
him.  And soon the inspector left the hospital
and went to see his chiefs.  There was no
evidence against any individual, for the
name of the man who rowed her up to Fairbridge
had not escaped Lavender's lips, but
Melville had not obeyed the summons she
had sent him, and the inspector was not
alone in wanting to know why.  He went to
Jermyn Street and asked for Mr. Ashley.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think he's at home," the hall
porter said, and the inspector went upstairs.
On the top landing he met Jervis coming
from another set of rooms.  "I want to see
Mr. Ashley," he said again.
</p>

<p>
"He's dining out," said Jervis.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite," said Jervis.  "I saw him dress,
and a commissionaire brought him a message
just as he was finished.  I haven't been in
his rooms since, but I'm sure he's out."
</p>

<p>
"Show me," said the inspector, and something
about him quelled Jervis's usual breezy
impertinence.
</p>

<p>
"Look for yourself, if you don't believe
me," he said, unlocking the door and flinging
it wide open.  "Perhaps you will believe
your own eyes."
</p>

<p>
The room bore unmistakable evidence of
Melville's flight.  His dress clothes were flung
upon the sofa, his despatch box stood open
on the table, his writing-table drawers were
unlocked.  Jervis's face of surprise only
confirmed the inspector's previous idea.
</p>

<p>
"You are Mr. Ashley's servant?" he enquired.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Jervis.
</p>

<p>
"Well, perhaps you can describe him to
me; fully, please.  I only want to make
enquiries in case there has been an accident.
You will not be doing him any injury."
</p>

<p>
So Jervis gave an accurate description of
his master, and found several photographs of
him to bear the description out.  From a
study of the wardrobe he saw what clothes
were missing, and suggested what Melville
might be wearing, and soon the inspector
was satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"You will be very well advised to keep a
still tongue in your head," he remarked.
"If Mr. Ashley comes back, well and good,
but if he doesn't, see that nobody comes into
these rooms unless I am with them at the
time," and, leaving Jervis dumbfounded, he
walked away.
</p>

<p>
Thus it came about that when the train in
which Melville was travelling reached Dover,
the police there, as at many another likely
spot for leaving England, were in possession
of a close description of him, and of
instructions not to lose sight of him if they saw
him.  His actual apprehension might be
deferred with safety, it could be accomplished
at any moment; but just as it is a
mistake to strike too soon when playing a
game fish, so it is often one to arrest a man
merely upon suspicion when a little delay
may justify the event and yet not prejudice
its successful performance.  Moreover, if Lady
Holt's statement were true, the police had
made one gross blunder as it was.
</p>

<p>
But while at Dover the detectives knew
what Melville was like, and had a clearly
defined course of action in the event of his
arriving there and crossing the Channel,
Melville had no idea of what they might be
like, and reached the end of this first stage
in his journey without devising any scheme
for his next movements.  He was so
persuaded that Lavender had betrayed him, and
that already a warrant must be out for his
arrest, that his heart was broken ere the
pursuit was begun.  What was the good of
thirty pounds to a man for whom the whole
world held no sanctuary?  Would it not
have been wiser to remain in London until he
could raise enough money to take him, at
any rate, an appreciable distance away?
There might be greater difficulty in leaving
the country a week hence, but the difficulty
would be more worth trying to overcome if
afterwards he had money to go on with.
Thirty pounds was almost useless.  Again he
blasphemed against his luck.  If the accident
had happened twenty-four hours later he
might have drawn a considerable sum from
Lavender, and even gone abroad.  And it
was just like his cursed ill-luck that the
cabman should be killed outright and Lavender
live to speak once more, whereas if the
converse had happened he would have been
out of danger for ever, and nobody would
have been a penny the worse except his
brother, whom everyone believed to be guilty,
and who might hang with pleasure so far as
Melville was concerned.
</p>

<p>
He got furtively out of the carriage and
scanned everybody about him; in each face
he fancied he detected the detectives whom
he supposed to be waiting for him, and even
when he got aboard the packet unobserved,
as he believed, he stood cowering on one side,
uncertain whether to go below or linger to
watch for the hand that surely must be laid
upon him soon.  His nerve was utterly gone,
and the only idea clear in his mind was that
if an attempt were made to arrest him ere
the packet started, he must jump overboard
and endeavour not to relax his grasp upon his
Gladstone bag, so that he might be sure of
not rising to the surface.  That much, at any
rate, was certain: he must not be taken
alive.
</p>

<p>
The night was mild, but very dark, and
Melville stood forward watching every figure
as it came aboard, and finding the really
short wait interminably long; but at last
the boat began to move away from the pier,
and he felt that he had another respite.
With a sudden access of terror, however, he
saw two men rush to the end of the pier
gesticulating wildly, and he waited, feeling
absolutely sick, until he saw they were too
late and had missed the boat.  None the
less, it accentuated his fear and stretched
his power of endurance to breaking point.
In reality, they were two harmless travellers,
one an acquaintance of his own, who had
tarried too long in the hotel and lost the
packet by mere carelessness.  But Melville
was convinced that they were the men
deputed to detain him, and while it was now
too late to draw back, it was fatal to go on.
They would certainly telegraph to the authorities
at Calais, and freedom was his for another
bare hour and a half.  How should he
utilise it?
</p>

<p>
The coast line was lost in the darkness,
and the lights grew smaller and smaller.
When the largest of them showed like
pin-pricks, Melville sighed and went below.  He
had something to do before the pin-pricks
should appear ahead and grow larger and
larger until they fell upon the deck of the
boat at Calais.  Going into the saloon he
opened his bag and sat down upon a couch.
Taking a sheet of paper, he wrote a pencil
note.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I do not know what Lavender Sinclair
may have said.  This much, at any rate, is
true.  My brother Ralph is innocent of the
crime imputed to him.  I declare this upon
my solemn oath.&mdash;MELVILLE ASHLEY."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He put the note, with Ralph's letter asking
for the loan on which so much had turned,
and Lavender's first letter from The Vale,
and his remaining paper money, into an
envelope, and addressed it to Mr. Tracy at
Lincoln's Inn Fields.  Then he strapped up
the bag, which he left unlocked, and went
on deck again.  This was the end of it all?
No god from a car could come to save him
this time; the Furies had reached their
quarry and were going to pull him down.
He found a more or less deserted place upon
the deck and stood, a dark figure, against
the rail; and so the moment came.  With
one last glance around to make sure he was
not observed, he got on to the outside of the
rail and dropped silently into the warm,
dark water.
</p>

<p>
When he rose he was surprised to see how
far behind he was left; he had no idea the
boat made such good speed.  He stifled an
impulse to call out, but the natural instinct
to swim was too strong to be resisted, and,
even managing to disengage himself from his
thin overcoat, he began with slow steady
strokes to follow in the wake of the boat.
The black mass of her shape grew lower in
the water, her lights drew away from him
with ever increasing speed, the salt burned
his eyelids and stung his face.  His arms
grew weaker with each more painful stroke,
until at length, with his eyes set upon the
far lights of the boat which represented man,
of whom he was forsaken, and never once
upon the stars, above which was enthroned
the God whom he had rejected, Melville gave
up the impossible task of living, and the
last mechanical effort ceased.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII.
<br><br>
THE PLACE OF PEACE.
</h3>

<p>
When Lavender knocked away the keystone
of the vaulted arch beneath which Ralph
Ashley was confined, the fabric fell to pieces
easily.  Provided with a copy of her depositions,
the police sought Mr. Tracy, and next
day he was engaged with the Treasury
solicitors discussing the Fairbridge murder
in the light of the new facts, and gathering
together sufficient evidence to corroborate
her statement and set the suspect free.
</p>

<p>
Of this, the most important part was
Melville's pencilled note, which reached
Mr. Tracy about five o'clock the following evening.
In itself his suicide was held to be sufficient;
that he had thrown himself overboard was
beyond question.  It was proved that he
had gone on board the packet at Dover and
that he was not on board at Calais; his
Gladstone bag was there, with the note and
the enclosures, and what had happened in
the interval was self-evident.  He, too, bore
witness to his brother's innocence, and
although, like Lavender, he did not say who
the murderer was, it was a simple matter
to name him now.  All that was necessary
was to prove that it was he who rowed
Lavender to Fairbridge the day the murder
was committed.
</p>

<p>
To do this was not very difficult.  Lucille
and Jervis both could prove that Lavender
had been to Jermyn Street the day before
the crime.  The maid could swear that on
the following morning her mistress went out
for the day, taking a basket containing
luncheon for two people, and that she returned
in the evening terribly agitated and wet
through.  The valet could swear that Mrs. Sinclair
took tea with Melville and asked him
to take her out next day; he had overheard
that much, although he did not overhear the
answer, but he swore that next morning his
master told him that he was going out and
would not require anything during the day;
that he was wearing flannels when he spoke,
and that those garments were soiled and
creased as if they had got wet when on the
following Monday they were sent to the
laundry.  The manager acknowledged his
surprise at finding Melville in when he
answered the bell in the evening, for it was
unusual for him to pass an entire afternoon
in his rooms without requiring service of any
kind, and his professed ignorance of Jervis's
absence was odd, in view of the fact that he
had himself given the leave of absence.
Careful investigation showed that the time
permitted of his going to Fairbridge and
returning by the hour he saw the manager.
The lock keeper at St. Martin's proved
that a lady and gentleman had hired his last
boat, and left it outside the lock on their
return in order to make a rush to catch a
train just due, which they must have missed
if they had waited to go through the lock
to the boathouse, and which would have got
him back to Jermyn Street in time to change
and affect to have been at home all day;
In Melville's rooms, moreover, the police
found ammunition similar to that found in
the gun-room at the Manor House, but no
trace of the revolver which it fitted.  Jervis
had often seen it, and swore that Melville
generally carried it in his hip pocket.  Was
it not, therefore, the one that Lavender
declared her companion had used and
afterwards dropped into the river?  Did not
Ralph's possession of its fellow prove his
own innocence and not his guilt, as
Mr. Tracy had always contended?
</p>

<p>
Nor when it came to the question of
motive was there any other difficulty.
The perjury Melville had committed in
denying all knowledge of Lady Holt's
existence, and the inferences to be drawn
from Sir Geoffrey's accounts, pointed
directly to the motive.  The story Ralph
had told to Mr. Tracy of the hundred
pounds explained the rest.  Sir Geoffrey had
paid Melville's debts and given him a final
two hundred and fifty pounds.  That Melville
lost at Monte Carlo, where he was when
Ralph wrote to him for the loan.  He applied
to his uncle for further help and got a hundred
pounds, as the cheque itself attested.  Yet,
in spite of the fraud and its penalties, only
averted by Ralph's generosity, Melville went
back to Fairbridge and got more money
from his uncle, as the cheque book again
demonstrated.  On what plea did he get
those further funds?  Obviously, under the
false pretence that Lady Holt, whom, as her
letter showed, he had seen in the brief interval,
was in poor circumstances; or else, perhaps,
as hush-money from his uncle, who believed
that his wife was dead.
</p>

<p>
Finally, Sir Geoffrey made a will and
refused to give Melville another penny for
himself or for Lavender, and then Melville
shot his uncle, either in a paroxysm of rage
at being baffled, or hoping to benefit under
some intestacy, for the will was only executed
a few days before the tragedy.  The whole
story was complete, and could no longer be
withstood.  Within the briefest possible period
the Crown dropped the case against Ralph
Ashley, and he was free.
</p>

<p>
It was with a face stern and hard as granite
that Ralph listened to Mr. Tracy's disclosure
of this horrible betrayal by his brother.  He
had been looking death in the face, and its
visage had almost turned him to stone,
although it could not make his high courage
quail.  It would have been bad enough if the
traitor had been any other man, but that it
should be his own brother, with whom he
had played as a child, dreamed such fair
dreams, and thought such long, long thoughts,
was the most cruel blow fate had ever dealt
him.  He marvelled at the cool courage with
which Melville had pitted himself against
the devil, and played the game right to the
end.  He shuddered as he tried to picture
what the end was like, when, with a certain
pagan courage, Melville threw himself into
death's cold embrace.  The life was
incomprehensible to him, but the death he could
find it in his heart to commend.
</p>

<p>
With Mr. Tracy he left the prison, of
which the high walls had been suffocating
him so long.
</p>

<p>
"I will telegraph to Gwendolen at once,"
he said, "saying I will be home to-morrow
night and asking her to await me there.  I
will go up to London with you now; there
is a lot that I must do."
</p>

<p>
His whole occupation that first day of
freedom was characteristic of the man.
Everything that could be devised to spare
his brother's memory he thought of and
arranged&mdash;everything, that is, that did not
detract from the absolute declaration of his
own innocence.  He provided for the payment
of Melville's debts, from the greatest
to the least, took possession of his personal
effects, so that nothing might fall into the
hands of curious strangers, and gave his
whole wardrobe and a generous gratuity to
Jervis on the understanding that he should
preserve silence as to his late master's
shortcomings.  And Jervis acted loyally in
accordance with the understanding, for he had
been a good and even affectionate servant to
Melville, who had always been kind and
generous to him; he was, indeed, Melville's
sincerest mourner.
</p>

<p>
Ralph thought of all who had contributed,
in however small a degree, to his acquittal.
Lucille was broken-hearted by Lavender's
death, and would accept nothing at his
hands.
</p>

<p>
"I don't need it," she said.  "Mrs. Sinclair
has left me everything she had, and
they tell me I shall never need to work again.
I'm going home to Geneva as soon as ever
I can."
</p>

<p>
She listened gratefully to Ralph's words
of sympathy.
</p>

<p>
"You've had a lot to put up with," she
sobbed, "but don't you believe my mistress
was a bad woman.  She was frightened into
holding her tongue.  Your brother frightened
her.  She was a changed woman from the
first unhappy day he crossed her path, and
didn't dare stand up to him; but whatever
she did, no one shall say to me that she was
a wicked woman."
</p>

<p>
And when Ralph soothed her she looked
up at him with eyes that were most pathetic.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know how you can be so forgiving
when you've been so wronged, I can't
forgive your brother.  But oh! how I wish
that it was you instead of him who came
into her life!  You could have told her, if
she had done wrong by Sir Geoffrey Holt,
how to put it right, and she would have done
it.  She never did a wrong thing knowingly
in all her life;" and, indeed, until fear came
upon her and upset her judgment as to the
proportion of things, Lucille's epitaph upon
her mistress was truer than many an epitaph
graven on stone and lying in cathedrals.
</p>

<p>
Next day Ralph arrived at Fairbridge.
He acknowledged silently the greetings of the
knot of people gathered at the station.  The
situation was not free from embarrassment
for them; their joy at his complete acquittal
would have found expression in some
tumultuous welcome but for the thought of his
brother, by the chance exposure of whose
treachery that acquittal had been secured.
</p>

<p>
Martin stood at the gate of the Manor
House bareheaded, and Ralph put out both
his hands.
</p>

<p>
"So I have come home safe, Martin,"
</p>

<p>
"The Lord be praised for it!" the butler
said; "the Lord be praised for it!  But,
oh! poor Master Melville!" and the tears
broke out and poured down the old fellow's
withered cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Melville!" echoed Ralph.  "Well,
we can't forget it, Martin, but we can forgive
him&mdash;you and I.  Surely if anybody can
forgive him it is you and I&mdash;because he
was&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He could not finish; the sight of the faithful
old servant sobbing as he bent over his
hands was too much for him, and the words
died away into a groan.
</p>

<p>
"God bless you, you dear old Martin!
Who can doubt of God when such kind hearts
as yours are beating round them?  Come,
you must take me to missy."
</p>

<p>
So Martin led the way to the library,
where Gwendolen stood alone, very pale and
nervous, but very sweet.  He opened the
door and tried to say Ralph's name, but it
would not come, and with his hands before
his face he ran away and left them alone
together.
</p>

<p class="thought">

</p>

<p>
That that part of the world which had
inclined to believe in Ralph's guilt hastened
to shower congratulations upon him goes
without saying, but the recipient of them
displayed something more than his wonted
taciturnity in his acknowledgment of them.
Almost more than anything else, he resented
the fact that anybody who knew him could
suppose him capable of such rank ingratitude
as to kill his only friend and benefactor.  He
tried to explain his brother's life by some
theory of criminal insanity, some lack of
moral sense, which made him not wholly
responsible for all his actions; but for the
lack of charity displayed by so many of the
average men and women of the world he had
nothing but savage detestation.
</p>

<p>
As soon as practicable after his release he
married Gwendolen, and spent the winter
and spring with her abroad, only returning
when early summer was painting the Manor
House garden in its fairest colours of leaf
and flower.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Austen welcomed them with delight,
gladly abdicating her position as regent of the
Manor House in favour of its new mistress,
and returning with unfeigned relief to the
familiar surroundings of her own home at
The Grange.
</p>

<p>
"No, I won't stay to-night," she said,
after giving them the sort of welcome one
can only get in English homes.  "You don't
really want me, and I must go and sacrifice
to my own household gods.  I've deserted
them much too long as it is."
</p>

<p>
So the night of their return they dined
alone, and after dinner walked down to the
houseboat.  It was inevitable that their doing
so should recall sharply all the story in which
they had played so important a part, and
for the first time for months they spoke of it
by mutual accord.
</p>

<p>
"This houseboat will always be associated
in my mind with some of the supreme
moments in my life," Gwendolen said softly.
"It was here that you proposed to me, here
that Mr. Anstruther arrested you, and here
that we are spending our first evening together
at home&mdash;all three times when one's heart
seems full to bursting."
</p>

<p>
Ralph looked at her gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Last time was a bad one, Gwen," he
said, in his deep voice.  "It was an awful
business!"
</p>

<p>
She stroked his hand, and the hard lines
in his face were softened.
</p>

<p>
"Let it make the present good time seem
all the better by contrast," she rejoined.
"After all, God's in His heaven, Ralph."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said slowly, "I suppose so;
but that wasn't the thought that kept my
pluck up during those weeks of suspense."
</p>

<p>
"What did?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"The thought of you," he answered, "and
your belief in me.  The knowledge that you
loved me and had faith in me made me swear
to keep the flag flying, don't you know.  It
wasn't the thought that God was in His
heaven and all that.  As a matter of fact,
all seemed very wrong with the world."
</p>

<p>
Gwendolen checked him.
</p>

<p>
"You ought to have remembered that He
gave you the love, if it meant so much," she
said.  "Sometimes I've thought that if
Melville had really loved somebody it would
have made all the difference and helped to
make a good man of him."
</p>

<p>
"Possibly," Ralph answered.  "The only
thing Melville ever loved was money&mdash;that
was at the bottom of it all."
</p>

<p>
"And so he had nothing to take him away
from himself," Gwendolen said.  "Even if
he hadn't been loved in return, the affection
would have made him unselfish, or at any
rate less selfish."
</p>

<p>
She spoke with obvious ignorance of the
fact that if there was one individual for
whom Melville felt anything like affection it
was herself, and Ralph looked at her in some
surprise, for on more than one occasion he
had been very much aware of it.  Melville
deserved some credit for not having told the
girl of it, for to love and not to be loved in
return by Gwendolen was enough to make
any man incline to go to the bad, and it
looked as if Melville had acted better than
usual in refraining from revealing his affection
and trying to cut his brother out.  But the
whole thing was unutterably painful still,
and his heart ached when his thoughts turned,
as they often did, to his last sight of Melville
standing in the witness box, so handsome, so
calm and self-possessed, apparently so eager
in his desire to help Ralph out of danger,
and all the while betraying him with a kiss.
His wife heard his sigh and stopped it with
a caress, and the touch of her lips brought
back happiness.  So they remained in silent
content, thanking God that the trouble was
overpast and that they were together and
at home.
</p>

<p>
The faint notes of distant music were
borne to them upon the breeze and died
away again, but the sound suggested
something else to Gwendolen.
</p>

<p>
"Ralph, I meant to ask you before.  Will
you give me Melville's violin?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," he answered, "if you want
it.  But you can't play it, can you?"
</p>

<p>
"No," she replied.  "I shall not even
try, but I should like to have it.  He was a
great musician.  I will keep his violin in
memory of the one great talent God gave
him, of which he never made anything but a
perfectly good use."
</p>

<p>
"You are a good woman, Gwendolen!"
Ralph said, with admiration.  "It's just
like you to have a pretty idea of that kind.
It will help me a bit, too," he added
reflectively.  "I find it none too easy to forget
about&mdash;all that, and I should like to
remember only what was good about him.  His
music was exquisite."
</p>

<p>
And so in the old Manor House at Fairbridge
the Amati, from whose strings Melville
drew harmonies that thrilled the soul of all
who heard them, remains as a perpetual
reminder of the one thing he did supremely
well.  The magic spell it wove when it spoke
in response to his command was as nothing
to the spell it weaves by its silence now,
helping them to forget all his sinfulness, and
reminding them only of the one great talent
God gave him of which he never made aught
but a perfectly good use.
